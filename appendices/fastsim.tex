\section{Introduction}
%##############################################

Simulating the detector response for arbitrary events is of crucial importance for understanding recorded collision data and to infer properties of the underlying physics in analyses. In \gls{cms} the standard package for simulation collision events is called ``FullSimulation''~\cite{1742-6596-396-2-022003,1742-6596-664-7-072022}. It is based on the \GEANT{}4 toolkit~\cite{Agostinelli2003250} and provides a detailed simulation of the detector response and an emulation of its readout systems. Produced events are reconstructed utilizing the same event reconstruction algorithms as applied on data.

A fast alternative to the standard simulation and reconstruction workflow is provided by the ``FastSimulation'' (\FSIM[format=hyperbf]) package of \gls{cms}. It delivers high-level analysis objects with sufficient accuracy for analyses while being tightly integrated into the \gls{cms} software framework~\cite{Bayatian:922757} along the standard simulation and reconstruction workflow. Its fast simulation speed of less than 10~s per event\footnote{For events with up to 60 pileup interactions.} is achieved by sidestepping certain parts in the standard simulation chain and utilizing various approximations instead. The two major CPU-intense parts which are replaced are the Geant4-based~\cite{Agostinelli2003250} simulation of particle interactions with the detector material and the track reconstruction. In particular, the complex, multistep algorithms which reconstruct tracks from energy depositions left by traversing charged particles in the \gls{cms} inner tracking system are exchanged with simpler versions that rely on truth-information about the simulated events. More details about the individual steps in the emulation of the track reconstruction are given in this chapter. The final analysis objects produced by \FSIM are indistinguishable from the ones produced by the standard simulation work flow. This enables an easy integration of \FSIM samples in analyses along event samples from the standard simulation and data.

Nowadays, the \FSIM package is successfully employed within \gls{cms} analyses. Typical use cases are searches for \acrfull{bsm} physics like \acrfull{susy}. These analyses require usually multiple signal samples which reflect various realizations of a new physics model. Other use cases are the evaluation of the impact of systematic uncertainties on a measurement like a variation of the renormalization and factorization scales or the top quark mass. A more general use case is to increase the statistics of existing samples for training \acrfull{mva} methods. Such a fast alternative is further motivated in the light of the planned increase of luminosity for which larger samples of simulated events with higher pileup conditions have to be produced.

The \FSIM package is introduced in this chapter with an emphasis on the employed track reconstruction for simulated events. The chapter is organized as follows. First an overview of the standard simulation and the specialized \FSIM workflows are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:fsim-workflow}. Then, the emulation of the track reconstruction is detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:fsim-tracking} which focuses in particular on the generation of reconstructed hits and the seeding of trajectories for initiating the iterative tracking sequence. A validation of the track reconstruction is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:fsim-validation} by comparing the obtain performances with the standard workflow. The chapter is concluded in Sec.~\ref{sec:fsim-conclusion}.

\section{Simulation workflow}
%##############################################
\label{sec:fsim-workflow}

The individual steps within the \gls{cms} software to obtain simulated events for comparison with data are sketched in the following with an emphasis on the differences between the standard and \FSIM workflows.

\begin{description}
\item[Generation] The sample generation commences by creating collections of particles with the help of \acrfull{mc} generators that are configured to produce events according to some physics process of interest. This step can also be performed independently of the core \gls{cms} software. Common interfaces with generator programs are provided through the \HEPMC[format=hyperbf]~\cite{Dobbs:2001ck,hepmc} or \LHEF[format=hyperbf]~\cite{Alwall:2006yp} event formats.

\item[Simulation] The trajectories of the generated particles are propagated through a geometrical model of the detector starting from the interaction point. As the particles traverse the detector, their interaction with the encountered material is simulated. In the standard simulation, the \GEANT{}4 package is utilized which provides a detailed propagation of particles in the magnetic field and a sophisticated simulation of the various interactions. 
%A simplification is performed in the simulation of electromagnetic and hadronic showers in the calorimeter systems where \GFLASH---a parameterized shower library---is utilized instead~\cite{1742-6596-293-1-012023,RAHMAT2012340}. 
In \FSIM a simplified detector geometry is utilized for the inner tracking system. Interactions are only simulated on infinitely thin cylindrical layers and endcap disks using parameterized models for energy loss through ionization, bremsstrahlung, photon conversion, and multiple scattering. Since a constant magnetic field is assumed as well the propagation of particles between the layers is performed analytically. In a final step the intersection points of the trajectories with the simplified geometry are projected onto the real geometry of the tracking system to create simulated hits associated to actual tracker pixel or strip modules. In the calorimetry systems the simulation of \gls{em} or hadronic showers is performed by sampling energy deposits from parameterized model of the expected longitudinal and transverse shower profiles per particle type and energy.

\item[Digitalization] In the digitalization step, an emulation of the detector readout systems is performed. After this stage, the event record in the standard simulation contains similar information as found in recorded raw data events. In \FSIM the digitalization algorithms of the standard simulation workflow are also utilized for the calorimeter systems. For the tracker hits no detailed simulation of the charge deposition is performed. Instead, the reconstruction of hits from charge clusters is only emulated by performing a smearing of the simulated hit positions. More details are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:fsim-hits} below.

\item[Reconstruction] In \FSIM the standard event reconstruction is applied to simulated events as well with the exception of the track reconstruction. Here, the computing-intense tracking algorithm with includes amongst others the \acrfull{ctf} algorithm~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014fea} are bypassed by utilizing truth-information about the simulated events instead to solve the combinatorial problem.
\end{description}

The tight integration of the \FSIM package within the \gls{cms} software allows to utilize most of the standard objects within its workflow so that simulated \FSIM samples can easily be used by analysts along samples generated with the standard event simulation and reconstructed data.

\section{Emulation of hit reconstruction}
%##############################################
\label{sec:fsim-hits}

An emulation of the local hit reconstruction for the tracker modules has to be performed since no detailed information of charge deposition is generated in the simulation step of \FSIM. To mimic the resolutions of the standard hit reconstruction the true hit positions are smeared. A new \FSIM module for position smearing has been developed which allows to manage various algorithms for position smearing side-by-side. It can be flexibly configured for any topology of the tracker. Additionally, each algorithm can be restricted to certain tracker modules only. A sketch of the inner workings of the new module is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fsim-hitsmearing}.

\myfigure{\label{fig:fsim-hitsmearing}Emulation of local hit reconstruction in \FSIM.  Various algorithm can be configured side-by-side. A flexible selection syntax allows to specify on a per module basis which hits to process.}{
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/fastsim/parcels.pdf}
}

First, the simulated hits are sorted according the associated tracker module. Then, algorithms for hit position smearing are loaded dynamically based on a configuration that is supplied by the user. Each instance of an algorithm can be configured to select and process only sorted hits belonging to certain tracker modules. The selection is achieved through a special syntax parser for evaluating the user configuration dynamically against the module properties. Technically, the \texttt{Boost.Spirit} framework~\cite{boostspirit} is utilized to implement the parser based on grammar rules written in \glshere{ebnf}. This allows to extended the syntax easily in case of future requirements that are currently uncovered.

Currently, a simple Gaussian smearing of the position is deployed for all strip modules where the configured resolution depends on the specific tracker subdetector (\gls{tib},\gls{tid},\gls{tob},\gls{tec}) and its layer. A more detailed emulation of hit reconstruction is employed for the pixel modules where parametrized distributions from the standard template-based hit reconstruction are utilized for the smearing. Furthermore, the new module allows the emulation of producing merged hits which occur in data when the distributions of the deposited charges from two particle transversing a tracker module overlap. Figure~\ref{fig:fsim-merge} shows a recent study of the probability of hit merging on the pixel modules. Such probability maps are expected to be used for the emulation of hit merging in the future.

\section{Emulation of track reconstruction}
%##############################################
\label{sec:fsim-tracking}

In \FSIM an emulation of the iterative track reconstruction is performed. The sequence of seeding, trajectory building and fitting and the iterative steps are kept similar to the standard track reconstruction but all algorithms are replaced with \FSIM-specific versions. A central idea to speedup the track reconstruction in \FSIM is to solve the combinatorial problem of associating reconstructed hits to particle trajectories by using \gls{mc}-truth information. An overview of the idea is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:fsim-tracking}. Starting from a collection containing all reconstructed hits, each hit is mapped back to the simulated track from which it originated in the simulation. Then, the iterative tracking is carried out where each step is performed multiple times per subset of hits that belongs to a single simulated track. This approach circumvents entirely any combinatorial confusion of hits. Thus, no fake tracks from a combination of spurious hits are emulated and the resulting tracking efficiency would in principle be 100\%. However, by accounting for dedicated selection criteria that are specified for each iteration in the standard reconstruction, the efficiency is decreased and becomes comparable to the one obtained in with the standard track reconstruction as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:fsim-validation} below.

\myfigure{\label{fig:fsim-tracking}The track reconstruction workflow in \FSIM. Details are given in the text.}{
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/fastsim/tracking.pdf}
}

The ability to produce merged hits originating from close particle tracks necessitated a recent extension of the \FSIM{}-specific data objects within the iterative tracking sequence. Instead of a one-to-one mapping of reconstructed hits to simulated tracks, close simulated hits can now result into a single reconstructed ``merged'' hit that can be shared between the final tracks within an iteration as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:fsim-tracking}. A further benefit of the extension is that the mapping itself can now be generated independently from the simulated track information which will allow the mix-in of wrong hit combinations leading to ``fake'' tracks in the future that are currently not emulated.

\subsection{New seeding algorithm}
%##############################################
\label{sec:fsim-seeding}

An algorithm has been developed to identify potential trajectory seed candidates while operating on an arbitrary number of seeding layers efficiently. In the original implementation, only doublets or triplets of hits could act as seeds. However, after the upgrade of the \gls{cms} detector a mixture of doublets, triplets, and quartets are envisaged for seeding. This is solved by organizing layer configurations in a tree-like structure as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fsim-seedingtree}. The new algorithm commences by iterating over a list of hits and linking them to a corresponding node in the tree if it is found on the desired layer. While the tree is being built, standard seed selection criteria are tested on the already found hit subsets. These are iteration-dependent and consists of various criteria such as the compatibility of the extrapolated trajectory with the beam spot or the minimum transverse momentum of a corresponding particle. A final seed candidate is found if hits at each node between the root and one of the leafs are found that are also compatible with any corresponding selection criteria. \todo{make better}

\section{Validation}
%##############################################
\label{sec:fsim-validation}

Track reconstruction within \FSIM is validated by comparing the tracks from the fast emulation with those obtained from the standard simulation and reconstruction. Figure~\ref{fig:fsim-eff-tracks} presents the tracking efficiency as a function of the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity. Here, the tracking efficiency is defined as the ratio of reconstructed tracks matched to simulated charged particles over the total number of charged particles within the tracker volume. Furthermore, the obtained resolution of the transverse momentum for reconstructed tracks is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fsim-res-track}. Overall, the plots demonstrate a good agreement of the \FSIM tracking performance with the one observed in the Geant4-based simulation and standard reconstruction.

\section{Conclusion}
%##############################################
\label{sec:fsim-conclusion}

The CMS \FSIM package provides a fast alternative to the standard simulation and reconstruction workflow. One of its major speedups is the use of truth information in the track reconstruction. Recent developments in the framework led to further flexibility in the emulation of hit reconstruction and to the usage of truth information in the iterative tracking sequence. In the short term, these developments will enable the emulation of merged hits originating from close particle tracks. In the long term, the increased flexibility will allow to adapt the emulation of track reconstruction to the planned upgrades of the CMS detector.




%\section{Introduction}
%Tracking of charged particles is one of the crucial ingredients to understand the physics behind LHC collisions. In the CMS experiment~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa}, tracks of charged particles are reconstructed and matched to information gathered by other subdetectors which improves the overall event reconstruction and resolution~\cite{CMS:2009nxa}. From reconstructed tracks higher analysis level objects like jets and the missing transverse energy are derived. 
%
%Sophisticated tracking algorithms are required to reconstruct tracks from the large amount of charged particles transversing the CMS detector at each bunch crossing. At typical instantaneous luminosities of about $10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which was reached in 2016, more than 500 reconstructed tracks can originate from 20--30 proton-proton interactions per crossing.
%
%The complex, multistep algorithms which reconstruct tracks from energy depositions left by traversing charged particles in the CMS tracker are very computing-intense. The standard track reconstruction procedure for data is applied to simulated events as well after they have passed the emulation of the electronic response of the detector. However, at this point in the simulation chain, it can be beneficial to sidestep the standard reconstruction by utilizing truth-information about the simulated events instead. In the CMS simulation framework this idea together with others has led to a fast alternative for simulating physics events called ``FastSimualtion'' (\FSIM[format=hyperbf]{})~\cite{fsimRahmat,fsimAndrea}. Such a fast alternative is further motivated in the light of the planned increase of luminosity for which larger samples of simulated events with higher pileup conditions have to be produced.
%
%The goal of the \FSIM package of CMS, which is tightly integrated into the CMS software~\cite{Bayatian:922757}, is to provide a fast alternative to the standard simulation and reconstruction workflow while delivering high-level analysis objects with sufficient accuracy. This is achieved by sidestepping certain parts in the production of simulated event samples to achieve a significant speed up. The two major CPU-intense parts which are replaced are the Geant4-based~\cite{Agostinelli2003250} simulation of particle interactions with the detector material and the track reconstruction. The final analysis objects are indistinguishable from the ones produced by the standard simulation work flow. This enables an easy integration of \FSIM samples in analyses along samples from the standard simulation and data.
%
%Nowadays, the \FSIM package is successfully employed within CMS analyses. Typical use cases are searches for beyond the standard model physics such as SUSY. Such analyses require usually multiple signal samples which reflect various realizations of a new physics model. Other use cases are the evaluations of the impact of systematic uncertainties on a measurement like a variation of the renormalization and factorization scales or the top quark mass. A more general use case is to enhance the statistics of existing samples for training multivariate analysis methods.
%
%This article is organized as follows: First, the steps involved in the standard track reconstruction are described briefly. Then, their alternative implementation within the \FSIM package is detailed with an emphasis on new developments in its tracking emulation. After the validation where the tracking performance of the standard simulation and reconstruction is compared to \FSIM this article is summarized and an outlook on planned developments is provided.

%\section{Standard track reconstruction within CMS}
%
%
%The standard track reconstruction is applied to real data and to simulated events from the standard Geant4-based simulation. It begins with the forming of hits on the pixel and strip modules of the tracker. Dedicated templates of charge depositions from simulation are compared to data to infer the position of a hit on a pixel module~\cite{Swartz:2007zz}. On the strip modules, hits are seeded from strips and subsequently combined with adjacent ones if their readout is sufficiently above their noise level.
%
%The reconstructed hits are then passed to the track reconstruction sequence which finds tracks iteratively. After each iteration the hits within the tracks that pass certain quality requirements are masked in next iterations to reduce the combinatorics. Currently, there are eight iterations deployed which will however be adapted after the upgrade of the pixel detector in 2017~\cite{Dominguez:1481838}. The first iterations target easy-identifiable, non-displaced tracks with respect to the interaction region, whereas the later iterations are designed for more complicated situations. Seeds are built from hit doublets or triplets on specific tracker layers which pass an iteration-dependent acceptance selection. Then, trajectories are constructed through the combinatorial track finder~(CTF) algorithm which tries to locate seed-compatible hits on other layers. It is based on Kalman filters and pattern recognition techniques.  Finally, the track parameters are estimated from a fit to the hit positions using a Runge-Kutta-based propagator which accounts for material effects and the inhomogeneous magnetic field. Tracks for analyses have to pass certain quality criteria depending on the iteration to reject ``fake'' tracks from spurious hit combinations. The fake rate is found to be about 5--15\% depending on the momentum and particle type in the standard simulation and reconstruction.
%
%More information on the standard track reconstruction can be found in Ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014fea}.
%
%
%\section{Fast emulation of track reconstruction}
%
%\todo{draw some image where fastsim is speeding things up}
%
%In \FSIM, the simulation of energy loss of particles as they traverse the detector is performed using parameterized probability functions for emulating energy loss through ionization, nuclear scattering, and bremsstrahlung. No detailed information of charge deposition on the pixel and strip modules is generated. To mimic the resolutions of the standard hit reconstruction the true hit positions are smeared. A new \FSIM module for position smearing was recently developed which allows to manage various algorithms for position smearing side-by-side. It can be flexibly configured for any topology of the tracker. Additionally, each algorithm can be restricted to certain tracker modules only. Currently, a simple Gaussian smearing of the position is deployed for all strip modules where the configured resolution depends on the specific tracker subdetector and its layer. A more detailed emulation of hit reconstruction is employed for the pixel modules where parametrized distributions from the standard template-based hit reconstruction are utilized for the smearing. Furthermore, the new module allows the emulation of merging of two hits which occurs when the distributions of the deposited charge from two transversing particle overlap. Figure~\ref{fig:fsim-merge} shows a recent study of the probability of hit merging on the pixel modules. Such probability maps are expected to be used for the emulation of hit merging in the future.

%\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figures/fastsim/merge.pdf}
%}
%
%By default, the seeding and trajectory building modules of the standard iterative tracking sequence are replaced completely within \FSIM. An overview is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:fsim-tracking}. The ability to produce merged hits originating from close particle tracks necessitated a recent refactoring of the \FSIM{}-specific data objects within the iterative tracking sequence. As motivated in the introduction, the main idea of sidestepping the reconstruction by using truth information about the origin of each hit remains, but had to be extended. Instead of a one-to-one mapping of reconstructed hits to true particle tracks, close simulated hits can now result into a single reconstructed ``merged'' hit that can be shared between the final tracks within an iteration. A further benefit is that the mapping itself can be generated independently from the truth information which will allow the mix-in of wrong hit combinations leading to ``fake'' tracks in the future which are currently not emulated.
%
%\myfigure{\label{fig:fsim-tracking}The track reconstruction workflow in \FSIM. Details are given in the text.}{
%\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/fastsim/tracking.pdf}
%}
%
%The seeding and trajectory building are restricted to the hits within a mapped subset. This removes completely any combinatorial problem from the iterative tracking in \FSIM resulting in a large reduction of computing time compared to the standard reconstruction. In the seeding step, the acceptance requirements are enforced by interfacing directly with the implemented criteria in the standard seeding step per iteration. The trajectory building process is trivial since the complete set of hits per track has already been defined. Finally, the track is fitted using the standard fit algorithm and the used hits are masked in next iterations.
%
%For the simulation of pileup interactions, additional minimum bias events are first premixed according to the desired pileup scenario and then added to the events at random. In \FSIM, tracks are already reconstructed in premixed events and then included in the event directly without interfering with the hit and track reconstruction of the main interaction. In analyses, the reconstruction of primary vertices allows to differentiate between tracks stemming from the hard or pileup interactions via their vertex association which motivates this approach.
