\label{ch:theory}

\intro{An overview of the \glshere{sm} is given in the following. First, the fundamental particles and their properties are introduced. Then, the electroweak and strong interactions are detailed. This includes a brief description of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism which generates particle masses through interactions with the Higgs field. After sketching the calculation of observables in perturbation theory, the chapter is concluded by highlighting some open questions of the \gls{sm}.}

The \glshere{sm} describes the interactions between fundamental particles. It is based on \glshere{qft} which allows to predict observables of particle interactions. Exemplary observables are production cross sections and decay rates of particles which can be calculated within its framework. The validity of the \gls{sm} is constantly challenged by comparing its predictions to experimental data. No significant deviations have been found so far that would hint towards physics \glshere{bsm}.

\section{Particle content}
%##############################################

Fundamental particles are defined as objects for which experiments have not revealed an internal structure. Hence, such particles are considered as point-like. They can be grouped by their spin into fermions with half-integer and bosons with integer spin. All fundamental fermions of the \gls{sm} have a spin of $\sfrac{1}{2}\,$. The fermions can be further divided into leptons and quarks where only the latter can participate in strong interactions. Tables~\ref{tab:theory-leptons} and~\ref{tab:theory-quarks} list the leptons and quarks respectively. Each column is called a generation. It encapsulates an isospin pair whose components are therefore also referred to as up- or down-type respectively. It is unknown why there are exactly three lepton and three quark generations. Atoms which form ordinary matter consist only of particles from the first generation. These are electrons, protons, and neutrons, where the latter two are bound states of uud quarks and udd quarks respectively.

For the masses of the neutrinos, only upper limits \gls{cl} are known. Those are derived by combining measurements of beta decay spectra with results from neutrino oscillation experiments. When the \gls{sm} was constructed in the mid 1970s, neutrinos were assumed to be massless. However, the observation of neutrino oscillations requires that at least two neutrino generations have non-zero masses~\cite{Fukuda:1998mi}.

The bosons of the \gls{sm} are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-bosons}. They are connected to fundamental interactions by requiring invariance of the Lagrangian density under certain gauge group transformations as demonstrated later in this chapter. With the exception of the Higgs boson, all other bosons carry a spin of~$1$. The Higgs boson is the only scalar fundamental particle~(spin~$0$) of the \gls{sm}. For a long time, it was a purely hypothetical particle. In July 2012, the \gls{atlas}~\cite{Aad:2012tfa} and \gls{cms}~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj} collaborations independently reported the observation of a Higgs-like particle. Further investigations whether this new particle exhibits the expected interactions with other particles revealed that it is consistent with the \gls{sm} Higgs boson~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau}. This discovery completed the \gls{sm} and thus gave further confidence into its theoretical foundation.

For each fundamental particle there exists a charge-conjugated partner called antiparticle. Other properties such as mass and spin are identical. The photon, Z boson, and Higgs boson are their own antiparticle. It is still under investigation if the neutrino is its own antiparticle. Fermions with such a property are called Majorana particles~\cite{Majorana2006}. Experimentally, this can be probed in double beta decays where in the case of Majorana neutrinos the decay can occur as $\mathrm{nn}\to\mathrm{pp}+\mathrm{e}^{\rmminus}\mathrm{e}^{\rmminus}$ without emitting two additional neutrinos. However, this scenario seems to be disfavored by recent results as reviewed in Ref.~\cite{Dell'Oro:2016dbc}.

\section{Quantum field theory}
%##############################################

In the framework of \gls{qft} particles are described as excitation modes of quantized fields. This is referred to as ``canonical'' or ``second'' quantization which allows to describe the dynamics of many-particle systems\footnote{An alternative quantization can be achieved via path integrals.}. Field operators can be decomposed as

\begin{equation}
\psi(x)=\sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N}}u_{i}(x)\,a_{i}\,,\qquad\psi^{\dagger}(x)=\sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N}}u^{\star}_{i}(x)\,a^{\dagger}_{i}\,,
\end{equation}

where $u_{i}(x)$ denotes the ordinary wave function of a single particle and $a^{\dagger}_{i}$ ($a_{i}$) its creation (annihilation) operator, respectively. As in classical mechanics the action of a system is calculated as

\begin{equation}
S=\int\mathrm{L}~\mathrm{d}t=\iint\mathcal{L}~\mathrm{d}^{3}\vec{x}\,\mathrm{d}t=\int\mathcal{L}~\mathrm{d}^{4}x\,,
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{L}$ denotes the Lagrangian density. For example, a system of free fermions is described by the Dirac Lagrangian density,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:theory-diracL}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Dirac}=\bar{\psi}\big(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m\big)\psi
\end{equation}

using the definitions $\partial_\mu\equiv\partial/\partial x_\mu$ with $\mu\in\{0\ldots3\}$ and $\bar{\psi}\equiv\psi^\dagger\gamma^{0}$, where $\gamma_\mu$ denote the Dirac matrices\footnote{Multiple representations are possible. The matrices need to satisfy a Clifford algebra with the anticommutation relation: $\big\{\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu\big\}=\gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu+\gamma^\nu\gamma^\mu=2g^{\mu\nu}$.}. The principle of least action, $\delta \mathrm{S}=0$, that is satisfied by the Euler-Lagrange equation yields the equation of motion as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bar{\psi}}-\frac{\partial}{\partial_\mu}\Bigg(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\big(\partial_\mu\bar{\psi}\big)}\Bigg)=\big(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m\big)\psi=0\,.
\end{equation}

Assuming $\psi\propto e^{-ip^{\mu}x_{\mu}}$ leads to the well-known energy-momentum relation

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
0&=\big(-i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m\big)^\star\cdot ~\big(-i\gamma^\nu\partial_\nu-m\big)\psi\\
 &=\big(\partial^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}+m^{2}\big)\psi \qquad \mathrm{(Klein\mbox{-}Gordon~equation)}  \\
 &\Rightarrow \big(-p^{\mu}p_{\mu}+m^{2}\big) = 0\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Interactions between particles are introduced in the \gls{sm} by requiring local invariance of the Lagrangian density for certain groups of gauge transformations. This concept is briefly demonstrated in the following where the requirement of local invariance under a $\mathrm{U(1)}$ transformation leads to \glshere{qed}. 

Applying the gauge transformation

\begin{equation}
\psi(x)~\mapsto~\psi^{\prime}(x)=\psi(x)\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-iq\cdot\alpha(x)}\,, \label{eq:theory-u1-trafo}
\end{equation}

on Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-diracL} yields

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\psi,\partial_\mu\psi)~\mapsto~\mathcal{L}(\psi^{\prime},\partial_\mu\psi^{\prime})=\bar{\psi}\,\Big(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu+q\,\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\alpha(x)-m\Big)\,\psi\not=\mathcal{L}(\psi,\partial_\mu\psi)\,,
\end{equation}

where the arbitrary phase $\alpha(x)$ is a function of the local space-time coordinate $x$\,. The invariance $\mathcal{L}(\psi,\partial_\mu\psi)=\mathcal{L}(\psi^{\prime},\partial_\mu\psi^{\prime})$ is restored by adding a bosonic spin-1 field $\mathrm{A}_{\mu}(x)$ to the Lagrangian density which interacts with $\psi$ and transforms under Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-u1-trafo} as

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{A}_{\mu}(x)~\mapsto~ \mathrm{A}^{\prime}_{\mu}(x)=\mathrm{A}_\mu(x)-\partial_\mu\alpha(x)\,.
\end{equation}

In summary, this procedure results in a Lagrangian density containing the following terms

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}=\hphantom{+}&\bar{\psi}\,\big(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m\big)\psi &(\mathrm{fermion~propagator}) \\
            +&q\,\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi \mathrm{A}_{\mu} &(\mathrm{interaction}) \label{eq:theory-EM-int}\\
            -&\tfrac{1}{4}\big(\partial_\mu \mathrm{A}_\nu-\partial_\nu \mathrm{A}_\mu\big)^{2} &(\mathrm{boson~propagator})
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where the gauge-invariant boson propagator describing the dynamics of a free $\mathrm{A}_\mu$ field has been added as well. The introduced interaction~(Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-EM-int}) which is required to ensure the invariance under the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ transformation~(Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-u1-trafo}) can be identified as electromagnetic interaction between a fermion described by the field $\psi$ with electric charge $q$ and a spin-1 particle, the photon, described by the field $\mathrm{A}_\mu$\,. The photon is predicted to be massless since adding a term of the form $m^{2}_\mathrm{A}\mathrm{A}^\mu \mathrm{A}_\mu$ would violate the invariance.

Other interactions of the \gls{sm} are connected to local gauge transformations as well~(see Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-bosons}) and can thus be introduced through similar procedures. A common property of the generated interactions follows from the Noether theorem which states that a conserved current exists for each differentiable symmetry of the action. Hence the charge associated to each gauge group is conserved. This is however already the case for a global transformation which does not depend on the space-time coordinate. The invariance even under a local gauge transformations is a puzzling feature of the theory.

\section{Electroweak interactions and Higgs mechanism}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-ewk}

Electromagnetic and weak interactions can be unified using a $\mathrm{U(1)}\otimes \mathrm{SU(2)}$ gauge group. A complication arises from the fact that the $\mathrm{W}$~and $\mathrm{Z}$~bosons, mediators of the weak interaction, are massive. The masses of these particles have to be introduced in a different way if the concept of local gauge invariance should continue to hold. Experimentally, the UA1 and UA2 experiments at the \gls{cern} \gls{sps} proton-antiproton collider measured their masses for the first time~\cite{Arnison:1983rp,Banner:1983jy,Arnison:1983mk,Bagnaia:1983zx} while the existence of weakly-interacting charged and neutral currents was already known from beta decay and bubble chamber experiments~\cite{Hasert:1973ff}.

Another feature of weak interactions is that parity is not conserved but instead maximally violated. This property manifests itself in a dependence of the interaction on the spin orientation of a particle with respect to its momentum. Experimentally, the Wu experiment~\cite{PhysRev.105.1413} discovered the violation of parity in ${}_{27}^{60}\mathrm{Co}\to{}_{28}^{60}\mathrm{Ni}+e^{\rmminus}\bar{\nu}_{e}\gamma\gamma$ decays by analyzing the direction of the escaping electron with respect to the polarization of the cobalt probe through an external magnetic field. In the electroweak theory fermion fields are decomposed into chiral eigenstates to account for the violation of parity using the projections

\begin{align}
\psi_\mathrm{L}\equiv\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{L}\psi=\tfrac{1}{2}\big(1-\gamma_{5}\big)\psi\,,\qquad \psi_\mathrm{R}\equiv\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{R}\psi=\tfrac{1}{2}\big(1+\gamma_{5}\big)\psi
\end{align}

with $\gamma_{5}=i\gamma_{0}\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}\gamma_{3}$\footnote{The matrix $\gamma_{5}$ has the following properties: $(\gamma_{5})^{\dagger}=\gamma_{5}\,$;~~$(\gamma_{5})^2=\mathrm{I}_\mathrm{4x4}\,$;~~ $\gamma_{5}\gamma_{\mu}+\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}=0\,$.} where $\psi_\mathrm{L}$ ($\psi_\mathrm{R}$) is called a ``left-handed'' (``right-handed'') fermion respectively. For massless particles Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-diracL} decouples into two independent equations for $\psi_\mathrm{L}$ and $\psi_\mathrm{R}$. The chirality (eigenvalue of $\gamma_{5}$) is then equal to the Lorentz-invariant helicity

\begin{equation}
H=\frac{\vec{p}\cdot\vec{s}}{|\vec{p}|}\,,
\end{equation}

which denotes whether the spin $\vec{s}$ of a particle is aligned along ($H=+1$) or against ($H=-1$) the momentum. For massive particles however Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-diracL} cannot be decomposed since chirality is not Lorentz-invariant.

In the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model~\cite{Salam:1964ry,Weinberg:1967tq,Glashow:1961tr} fermion fields are split into left-handed doublet fields

\begin{align}
\vec{\mathrm{E}}_\mathrm{L}=\left\{\colvec{2}{\nu_\mathrm{e,L}}{e^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{L}},\colvec{2}{\nu_{\mu,\mathrm{L}}}{\mu^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{L}},\colvec{2}{\nu_{\tau,\mathrm{L}}}{\tau^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{L}}\right\} \label{eq:theory-su2-doublets}\,,\quad
\vec{\mathrm{Q}}_\mathrm{L}=\left\{\colvec{2}{\mathrm{u}_\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{d}_\mathrm{L}},\colvec{2}{\mathrm{c}_\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{s}_\mathrm{L}},\colvec{2}{\mathrm{t}_\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{L}}\right\} 
\end{align}

and right-handed singlet fields

\begin{align}
\vec{\mathrm{e}}_\mathrm{R}=\big\{\mathrm{e}^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{R},\mu^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{R},\tau^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{R}\big\}\,,\quad\vec{\mathrm{u}}_\mathrm{R}=\big\{\mathrm{u}_\mathrm{R},\mathrm{c}_\mathrm{R},\mathrm{t}_\mathrm{R}\big\}\,,\quad\vec{\mathrm{d}}_\mathrm{R}=\big\{\mathrm{d}_\mathrm{R},\mathrm{s}_\mathrm{R},\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{R}\big\} \label{eq:theory-su2-singlets}
\end{align}

of the $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ group. Right-handed neutrinos do not participate in any interactions described by the \gls{sm}. The gauge transformation of the combined $\mathrm{U(1)}\otimes \mathrm{SU(2)}$ group is

\begin{equation}
\psi(x)~\mapsto~\psi^\prime(x)=\psi(x)\,\cdot\,\underbrace{\mathrm{e}^{-\tfrac{1}{2}ig\,\vec{\alpha}(x)\cdot\vec{\omega}}}_\mathrm{SU(2)}\,\cdot\,\underbrace{\mathrm{e}^{-\tfrac{1}{2}ig^{\prime}\,\beta(x)}}_\mathrm{U(1)}\,, \label{eq:theory-u1su2-transformation}
\end{equation}

where $\omega_{a}$~($a\in\{1,2,3\}$) denote the Pauli matrices and $g$\,, $g^{\prime}$ the corresponding conserved charges. This leads to four boson fields, $\mathrm{W}^{a}$ and $\mathrm{B}$, that interact with the fermions. In analogy to Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-EM-int} one obtains the \glshere{ewk} interactions

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{\gls{ewk}~ int.}~~=\hphantom{+}\sum_{i}^\mathrm{doublets}\,&\bar{\psi}^{i}_\mathrm{L}~\gamma^{\mu}\Big(\tfrac{1}{2}g\,\vec{\mathrm{W}}_{\mu}\cdot\vec{\omega}+\tfrac{1}{2}g^{\prime}\,\mathrm{B}_{\mu}\Big)\,\psi^{i}_\mathrm{L} \nonumber\\
+\sum_{j}^\mathrm{singlets}\,&\bar{\psi}^{j}_\mathrm{R}~\gamma^{\mu}\Big(\tfrac{1}{2}g^{\prime}\,\mathrm{B}_{\mu}\Big)\,\psi^{j}_\mathrm{R} + \mathrm{\gls{hc}} \label{eq:theory-codev-su2-interaction}
\end{align}

where the summations are implied over the fermion doublet and singlet fields. A fermion mass term $ m_\mathrm{f}\,\bar{\psi}{}_\mathrm{f}\psi_\mathrm{f}=m_\mathrm{f}\,(\bar{\psi}{}_\mathrm{f,L}\psi_\mathrm{f,R}+\bar{\psi}{}_\mathrm{f,R}\psi_\mathrm{f,L})$ cannot be added to the Lagrangian density since it violates the invariance under the $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ transformation. This is solved by the Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble-mechanism~\cite{HIGGS1964132,PhysRevLett.13.508,PhysRevLett.13.321,PhysRevLett.13.585} which introduces mass terms not only for fermions but also for the gauge bosons through the concept of ``symmetry breaking''. For this, a new scalar $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ doublet field $\phi=(\phi^{\rmplus},\phi^{0})$\footnote{$\phi^{\rmplus}$ annihilates positively charge scalar particles / creates antiparticles with negative charge; $\phi^{0}$ annihilates neutral particles / creates neutral antiparticles.}, invariant under Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-u1su2-transformation}, is added to the Lagrangian density which interacts with the gauge bosons as

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\phi}&=\big(D_{\mu}\phi\big)^{\dagger}\big(D^{\mu}\phi\big)-\mathrm{V}(\phi) \label{eq:theory-phi-propagator} \\
D^{\mu}\phi&=\big(\partial^{\mu}-\tfrac{1}{2}ig\vec{\mathrm{W}}^{\mu}\cdot\vec{\omega}-\tfrac{1}{2}ig^{\prime}\mathrm{B}^{\mu}\big)\phi\,. \label{eq:theory-phi-codev}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

In addition $\phi$ has a potential 

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{V}(\phi)=-\mu^2\phi^\dagger\phi+\tfrac{1}{2}\lambda(\phi^\dagger\phi)^2 \label{eq:theory-higgs-pot}
\end{equation}

in the form of a ``Mexican hat'' as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-higgs-potential} that leads to a non-zero \glshere{vev} for $\phi$ for $\mu^2>0$ of 

\begin{equation}
\phi_0=\sqrt{\frac{\mu^{2}}{2\lambda}}\equiv \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}\,.
\end{equation}

\myfigure{\label{fig:theory-higgs-potential}The ``Mexican hat'' potential of the Higgs field $\phi$ with a non-zero \acrfull{vev} $\phi_0$ that leads to symmetry breaking.}{
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figures/theory/higgspot.pdf}
}

One says that this shifted \gls{vev} ``breaks'' the $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ symmetry when parameterizing $\phi$ around the minimum of $V(\phi)$ as

\begin{equation}
\phi(x) \Bigg|_{\phi_0} =~\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\colvec{2}{0}{v+\mathrm{H}(x)}\cdot \exp\left(-i\,\frac{\vec{\theta}(x)\cdot\vec{\omega}}{2v}\right)\,, \label{eq:theory-phi-dev}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{\theta}$ denotes three so-called ``Goldstone'' bosons and $\mathrm{H}$ the Higgs boson. In fact, the symmetry still exists but is ``hidden''. A $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ transformation called ``unitary gauge'' can be performed such that $\vec{\theta}$ vanishes. One says that these three Goldstone bosons and their degrees of freedom are ``eaten'' by the $\mathrm{W}$ and $\mathrm{Z}$~bosons to become massive. Hence, through the extra degrees of freedom they can also have a longitudinal polarization after symmetry breaking. The parametrization of $\phi$ is chosen such that it leaves the minimum invariant under the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ subgroup transformation

\begin{equation}
\psi(x)~\mapsto~\psi^\prime(x)=\psi(x)\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-\tfrac{1}{2}ig\,\alpha_{3}(x)\cdot\omega_{3}}\,\cdot\,\mathrm{e}^{-\tfrac{1}{2}ig^{\prime}\,\beta(x)}\,. \label{eq:theory-broken-u1-trans}
\end{equation}

Inserting Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-phi-dev} into Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-phi-propagator} yields amongst others the following Lagrangian densities capturing the non-interacting terms:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Higgs~boson}=&\hphantom{-}\tfrac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}\mathrm{H}^{\dagger})(\partial^{\mu}\mathrm{H})-\lambda^2 v^2 \mathrm{H}^2 \label{eq:theory-higgs} \\
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{W_1,W_2~bosons}=&-\tfrac{1}{4}\big(\mathrm{W}_{1,\mu\nu}\mathrm{W}^{\mu\nu}_{1}+\mathrm{W}_{2,\mu\nu}\mathrm{W}^{\mu\nu}_{2}\big)\nonumber\\&+\tfrac{1}{8}g^2 v^2 \big(\mathrm{W}_{1,\mu} \mathrm{W}_{1}^{\mu}+\mathrm{W}_{2,\mu} \mathrm{W}_{2}^{\mu}\big) \label{eq:theory-a1a2} \\
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{W_3,B~bosons}=&-\tfrac{1}{4}\big(\mathrm{B}_{\mu\nu}\mathrm{B}^{\mu\nu}+\mathrm{W}_{3,\mu\nu}\mathrm{W}^{\mu\nu}_{3}\big)\nonumber\\
&+\tfrac{1}{8}v^2 \big(g\mathrm{W}_{3,\mu}-g^{\prime}\mathrm{B}_\mu\big)\big(g\mathrm{W}_{3}^{\mu}-g^{\prime}\mathrm{B}^\mu\big)\,. \label{eq:theory-a3b}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The first term (Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-higgs}) describes the free scalar Higgs boson with mass $m_\mathrm{H}=\lambda v$. Next, the $\mathrm{W}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{W}_{2}$
fields in Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-a1a2} can be identified as a particle/antiparticle pair $\mathrm{W}^{\pm}=(\mathrm{W}_1\mp i\mathrm{W}_2)/\sqrt{2}$ with mass $m_\mathrm{W}=\frac{1}{2}gv$\,. Lastly, the fields $\mathrm{W}_3$ and $\mathrm{B}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-a3b} appear to be in a mixed-mass state. By performing a rotation of the couplings

\begin{equation}
\colvec{2}{\mathrm{Z}}{\mathrm{A}}=\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta_\mathrm{W} & -\sin\theta_\mathrm{W} \\
\sin\theta_\mathrm{W} & \hphantom{-}\cos\theta_\mathrm{W}
\end{pmatrix}
\colvec{2}{\mathrm{W}_{3}}{\mathrm{B}}\,,\qquad \cos\theta_\mathrm{W}=\frac{g}{\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime 2}}}\,,
\end{equation}

where $\theta_\mathrm{W}$ is called the ``weak-mixing'' or ``Weinberg'' angle, another massive boson, the $\mathrm{Z}$~boson, with mass $m_\mathrm{Z}=v\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime2}}/2$ and a massless boson $\mathrm{A}_\mu$, the photon, can be identified. The angle is determined as $\sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W} \approx 0.23$~\cite{Olive:2016xmw} through the couplings $g$ and $g^\prime$. Equation~\ref{eq:theory-phi-propagator} also yields the relation $\rho\equiv m_\mathrm{W}^{2}/(m_\mathrm{Z}^{2}\cdot\cos\theta_\mathrm{W}^{2})=1$ which is commonly referred to as the ``custodial symmetry''. Rewriting the covariant derivative of Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-phi-codev} into these mass eigenstates yields

\begin{align}
D_\mu=&\hphantom{-}\partial_\mu~+~i\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\Big(\mathrm{W}^{\rmplus}_\mu T^{\rmplus}+\mathrm{W}^{\rmminus}_\mu T^{\rmminus}\Big)\nonumber\\
&-i\,\frac{g^2\,T_3-g^{\prime 2}\,Y}{\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime 2}}}\cdot\mathrm{Z}_\mu~-~i\,\frac{g^{\prime}g\,\big(T_3+Y\big)}{\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime 2}}}\cdot \mathrm{A}_\mu\,, \label{eq:theory-codev-breaking}
\end{align}

where $Y$ denotes the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ so-called ``hyper'' charge, $T_3$ the weak isospin (eigenvalue of $\omega_{3}$), and $T^{\pm}$ the ladder operators for increasing or lowering $T_3$. From the coupling to the photon one can read off the electric coupling constant to be 

\begin{equation}
e=\frac{g^{\prime}\,g}{\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime 2}}}\,,
\end{equation}

which is measured as $\aem=e^2/(4\pi)\approx1/137$~\cite{Olive:2016xmw} and the corresponding electric charge to be $Q=T_3+Y$ which is invariant under Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-broken-u1-trans} and thus conserved. For the weak coupling constant one finds the relation $e=g\cdot\sin\theta_\mathrm{W}$ which yields $\aw=\aem/\sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W}\approx0.032$. The value of the \gls{vev} can be estimated from muon lifetime measurements (e.g. Ref.~\cite{PhysRevLett.106.041803}) through the Fermi coupling constant, $\mathrm{G}_\mathrm{F}$, as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{G}_\mathrm{F}}{\sqrt{2}}\approx\frac{g^2}{8\,m_\mathrm{W}^{2}}=\frac{1}{2\,v^2}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad v=(\sqrt{2}\,\mathrm{G}_\mathrm{F})^{-1/2}\approx 246~\GeV\,.
\end{equation}
 
A consequence of electroweak symmetry breaking is the prediction of the Higgs boson. Its mass is not predicted by the \gls{sm} since it is a function of the free parameter $\lambda$ which required to consider multiple mass hypotheses in searches for the Higgs boson. Almost fifty years after its prediction the Higgs boson was finally discovered in July 2012 independently by the \gls{atlas}~\cite{Aad:2012tfa} and \gls{cms}~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj} collaborations and thus completed the electroweak theory. 


By introducing gauge-invariant Yukawa interactions between the fermions and the Higgs field as 

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Yukawa~lepton~int.}=&-\sum_{i}\lambda_{e}^{ii}\cdot\bar{\mathrm{E}}^{i}_\mathrm{L}\phi\cdot\mathrm{e}^{i}_\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{\gls{hc}}\,, \label{eq:theory-lepton-yukawa}\\
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Yukawa~quark~int.}=&-\sum_{i,j}\lambda_{d}^{ij}\cdot\bar{\mathrm{Q}}^{i}_\mathrm{L}\phi\cdot\mathrm{d}^{j}_\mathrm{R}-\sum_{i,j,k}\lambda_{u}^{ik}\cdot\bar{\mathrm{Q}}^{i}_\mathrm{L}\epsilon^{ij}\phi^{j}\cdot\mathrm{u}^{k}_\mathrm{R} +\mathrm{\gls{hc}}\,, \label{eq:theory-quark-yukawa}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $\lambda_{X}^{ij}\,$  denote the coupling strengths and $\epsilon^{ij}$ an antisymmetric matrix, fermion mass terms are generated as well. After the symmetry breaking mass terms for the electron, muon and tau lepton of 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Yukawa~lepton~int.}\supset-\underbrace{\frac{\lambda_\mathrm{e} v}{\sqrt{2}}\,}_{\equiv m_\mathrm{e}}\bar{\mathrm{e}}_\mathrm{L}\mathrm{e}_\mathrm{R}-\underbrace{\frac{\lambda_{\mu} v}{\sqrt{2}}\,}_{\equiv m_{\mu}}\bar{\mu}_\mathrm{L}{\mu}_\mathrm{R}-\underbrace{\frac{\lambda_{\tau} v}{\sqrt{2}}\,}_{\equiv m_{\tau}}\bar{\tau}_\mathrm{L}{\tau}_\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{\gls{hc}}
\end{equation}

can be identified. The quarks can be disentangled from their mixed-mass state through a rotation of the fields 

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{u}^{i}_\mathrm{L}~\mapsto~ U^{ij}_\mathrm{u}\mathrm{u}^{j}_\mathrm{L}\,,\qquad \mathrm{d}^{i}_\mathrm{L}~\mapsto~ U^{ij}_\mathrm{d}\mathrm{d}^{j}_\mathrm{L}\,,
\end{equation}

which allows to write the Lagrangian density in the quark mass eigenstates. In particular, using Eqs.~\ref{eq:theory-codev-su2-interaction} and~\ref{eq:theory-codev-breaking}, this yields the interaction terms

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{W}\bar{\mathrm{f}}\mathrm{f}~\mathrm{int.}}=\hphantom{+}i&\frac{g}{2\sqrt{2}}\sum_{i}\,\Big(\bar{\nu}_{i}(\gamma^\mu-\gamma^\mu\gamma^5) \mathrm{W}^{\rmplus}_\mu\,\ell^{\rmminus}_{i}~+~{\ell}^{\rmplus}_{i}(\gamma^\mu-\gamma^\mu\gamma^5) \mathrm{W}^{\rmminus}_\mu\,\nu_{i}\Big)\nonumber\\
+i&\frac{g}{2\sqrt{2}}\sum_{i,j}\,\Big(\mathrm{V}_{ij}\,\bar{\mathrm{u}}_{i}(\gamma^\mu-\gamma^\mu\gamma^5) \mathrm{W}^{\rmplus}_\mu\,\mathrm{d}_{j}~+~\mathrm{V}_{ij}^\dagger\,\bar{\mathrm{d}}_{i}(\gamma^\mu-\gamma^\mu\gamma^5) \mathrm{W}^{\rmminus}_\mu\,\mathrm{u}_{j}\Big) \label{eq:theory-qqW-int}
\end{align}

between the $\mathrm{W}$~bosons and fermions where $\mathrm{V}_{ij}=(U^\dagger_\mathrm{u}U_\mathrm{d})_{ij}$ denotes the \glshere{ckm} matrix. Its elements are free parameters of the \gls{sm} and have to be measured experimentally. A global fit using a multitude of measurements~\cite{Olive:2016xmw} while assuming unitarity for the three quark generations yields

\begin{align}
V_\mathrm{\gls{ckm}}&=\begin{pmatrix}
|\ckm{ud}| & |\ckm{us}| & |\ckm{ub}| \\
|\ckm{cd}| & |\ckm{cs}| & |\ckm{cb}| \\
|\ckm{td}| & |\ckm{ts}| & |\ckm{tb}| 
\end{pmatrix}\nonumber
\\&=
\begin{pmatrix}
0.9743\pm0.0001 & 0.2250\pm0.0005 & 0.0036\pm0.0001 \\
0.2249\pm0.0005 & 0.9735\pm0.0001 & 0.0411\pm0.0013 \\
0.0088\pm0.0003 & 0.0403\pm0.0013 & 0.9992\pm0.0001 
\end{pmatrix}\,. \label{eq:theory-ckm}
\end{align}


The coupling structure, $\gamma_{\mu}-\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\,$, between $\mathrm{W}$~bosons and the fermions is referred to as a \glshere{va} structure because of its spatial transformation properties. Axial vectors do not switch sign under parity transformation  unlike normal spatial vectors\footnote{A typical example of an axial vector (also known as pseudovector) is the angular momentum $\vec{L}=\vec{r}\times \vec{p}\,$.}. This allows only left-handed fermions or right-handed antifermions to couple to $\mathrm{W}$~bosons as observed by the Wu experiment.

\section{Strong interactions}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-qcd}

The theory of \glshere{qcd} describes the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. It is connected to a $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ gauge group with the Lagrangian density 

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{\gls{qcd}}=\bar{\psi}i\gamma^{\mu}\big(\partial_{\mu}-ig_{s}\,\vec{\mathrm{G}}_\mu\cdot\vec{\lambda}\big)\psi-\tfrac{1}{4}\vec{\mathrm{G}}_{\mu\nu}\vec{\mathrm{G}}^{\mu\nu}\,,\qquad \psi=\colvec{3}{\psi_\mathrm{red}}{\psi_\mathrm{green}}{\psi_\mathrm{blue}}\,,
\end{align}

which is invariant under the local gauge transformation

\begin{equation}
\psi(x)~\mapsto~\psi^\prime(x)=\psi(x)\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-ig_{s}\,\vec{\alpha}(x)\cdot\vec{\lambda}}\,.
\end{equation}

The fields $\vec{\mathrm{G}}_\mu$ describe eight gluons which represent the massless gauge bosons of the group. The conserved charge of the group is called ``color'' (red, green, blue) which is equal in strength for all charges. The generators $\lambda_a$~($a\in\{1\ldots8\}$) obey the relation $[\lambda_a,\lambda_b]=if_{abc}\lambda^c$ with the antisymmetric structure constant $f_{abc}$. A common representation of $\vec{\lambda}$ is given by the Gell-Mann matrices. The non-abelian group structure leads to gluon self-interactions through the gluon field strength tensor

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{G}_{\mu\nu}^{a}=\partial_{\mu} \mathrm{G}_\nu^{a}-\partial_{\nu} \mathrm{G}_{\mu}^{a}+g_{s}\,f^{abc}\mathrm{G}_{\mu,b}\mathrm{G}_{\nu,c}\,.
\end{equation}

No free quarks can exist in nature because of a phenomenon called ``color-confinement''. The \gls{qcd} potential between two quarks can be approximated as a ``Coulomb-plus-linear'' potential~\cite{Sumino2003173}

\begin{equation}
V(r)\approx-\frac{4\cdot\as}{3r}+k\cdot r\,,\quad \as=\frac{g_{s}^2}{4\pi}\,,
\end{equation}

where a linear term dominates at large distances $r$ or equivalently small exchanged energies. The factor $k$ can be understood as a ``gluon-spring'' tension similar to that of a harmonic oscillator. New quark/antiquark pairs can be created from the vacuum if the gluon field energy exceeds the mass of the new pair. This can lead to a cascade of particles emerging from the gluon field at sufficiently large energies which bind ``free'' quarks into color-neutral singlets called hadrons. Such a process is referred to as hadronization. In experiments the momentum of a quark or gluon candidate is therefore inferred by clustering collimated particles into jets.

Hadrons can be either mesons which consist of quark-antiquark pairs~($\mathrm{q}\bar{\mathrm{q}}$) or baryons consisting of quark triplets~($\mathrm{qqq}$). These constituents of a hadron are referred to as ``valence quarks''. Common mesons are the pions $\uppi^{\rmplus}$~($\mathrm{u}\bar{\mathrm{d}}$), $\uppi^{0}$~($(\mathrm{u}\bar{\mathrm{u}}-\mathrm{d}\bar{\mathrm{d}})/\sqrt{2}$), kaons $\mathrm{K}^{\rmplus}$~($\mathrm{u}\bar{\mathrm{s}}$), $\mathrm{K}^{0}$~($\mathrm{d}\bar{\mathrm{s}}$) and $\mathrm{J}/\Psi$~($\mathrm{c}\bar{\mathrm{c}}$). Typical baryons are the proton~($\mathrm{uud}$), the neutron~($\mathrm{udd}$), and~$\Lambda^{0}$~($\mathrm{uds}$). The baryon number, $\mathrm{B}\equiv N\text{(baryons)}-N\text{(antibaryons)}\,$, is conserved in interactions. Hence, the proton is stable and cannot decay because it is the lightest baryon. In 2003, a new bound state containing four quarks has been observed by the Belle experiment~\cite{PhysRevLett.91.262001} at \gls{kek}, Japan. The \gls{lhcb} experiment at the \gls{lhc}, \gls{cern} confirmed this observation in 2013~\cite{Aaij:2013zoa} followed by the discovery of more so-called ``tetraquark'' candidates~\cite{Aaij:2014jqa,Aaij:2016iza} and even ``pentaquarks'' forming a bound state of five quarks~\cite{Aaij:2015tga}.

Besides the valence quarks, virtual quarks (so-called ``sea quarks'') and gluons are considered constituents of a hadron as well. This whole group of particles is commonly referred to as partons. In hadron collision experiments at a sufficiently high momentum transfer, one can approximate all partons as free which allows to treat hadron-hadron scattering as a single parton-parton interaction instead~\cite{Feynman:1969wa}. The momentum of a parton is expressed in terms of the fraction of the hadron momentum $\vec{p}_\mathrm{parton}=x\, \vec{p}_\mathrm{hadron}\,$, where $x$ is also referred to as ``Bj\"orken scaling variable''~\cite{Bjorken:1967fb}. Then, the probability of 
finding two parton flavors $f_{i}$ with momentum fraction $x_{i}$ interacting at an energy scale $\mu_\mathrm{F}$ in a hadron-hadron collision is given by the \glshere{pdf} as $\mathrm{\gls{pdf}}(x_{1},f_{1},\mu_\mathrm{F})\cdot\mathrm{\gls{pdf}}(x_{2},f_{2},\mu_\mathrm{F})\,$. The \glspl{pdf} are normalized such that

\begin{equation}
\sum_{f}^\mathrm{partons}\int_{0}^{1}\mathrm{d}x~x\cdot \mathrm{PDF}(x,\mu_\mathrm{F},f)=1
\end{equation}

yields the total momentum of the hadron. The scale $\mu_\mathrm{F}$ is called ``factorization scale'' below which non-perturbative low energy effects such as soft gluon emissions have been absorbed into the \gls{pdf}. Measuring the \glspl{pdf} at scale $\mu_\mathrm{F}$, one can extrapolate them to any other scale by solving the DGLAP\footnote{Named after the authors: Dokshitzer, Gribow, Lipatow, Altarelli, and Parisi.} equation~\cite{Dokshitzer:1977sg,Gribov:1972ri,Altarelli:1977zs}. A review of common \gls{pdf} sets which are currently used in descriptions of \gls{lhc} collisions can be found in Ref.~\cite{Accardi2016}. There are various groups estimating \gls{pdf} sets from fits to experimental data using different approaches; e.g. CTEQ, MMHT~(formerly MSTW), ABM, HERAPDF, and NNPDF. Exemplary distributions taken from the NNPDF group~(version 3.0), using the \LHAPDF[format=hyperbf] library~\cite{Buckley:2014ana}, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-nnpdf-dist} for $\mu_\mathrm{F}=10~\GeV$ and $\mu_\mathrm{F}=100~\GeV$. More information on this \gls{pdf} set can be found in Ref.~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}. At a momentum fraction of $x\approx0.2$ one can observe an excess of the up and down quark distributions as expected from the valence quark composition of the proton. These vanish at low momentum fractions at which the contributions from virtual sea quarks and gluons dominate.

}

At high energies, quantum fluctuations lead to divergences. In order to let a theory still describe the experimental energy regime, physical quantities are redefined at the so-called ``renormalization scale'' $\mu_\mathrm{R}$. This leads amongst others to a ``running'' behavior of the coupling constants as a function of $\mu_\mathrm{R}$. Beyond this scale, high energy effects such as loop corrections to propagators~(``self-energy'') are absorbed in the physical quantities through a renormalization of the fields. In particular, the running behavior of the strong coupling constant is found to be 

\begin{equation}
\as(\mu_\mathrm{R})=\frac{\as(\mu_{0}^{2})}{1+\as(\mu_\mathrm{0}^2)\cdot\tfrac{33-2\cdot n_f}{12\pi}\cdot\ln\Big(\tfrac{|\mu_\mathrm{R}^2|}{\mu_{0}^{2}}\Big)}\,, \label{eq:theory-running-as}
\end{equation}

where $n_f$ denotes the number of quarks and $\mu_{0}$ is a reference scale where the coupling is known from measurements, e.g. $\mu_{0}=m_\mathrm{Z}\,$. The current world average of the strong coupling constant at the $\mathrm{Z}$~boson mass is estimated to be $\as(m_\mathrm{Z})=0.1181\pm0.0011$~\cite{Olive:2016xmw}. 

Quarks can be treated as ``asymptotically free'' since the strong coupling decreases towards larger energies. On the other hand, following the behavior of $\as(\mu^2_\mathrm{R})$ to lower energies, a limit $\Lambda_\mathrm{\gls{qcd}}\approx 200~\MeV$ is found at which $\as$ becomes even larger than one. Below such energies, perturbative calculations of observables can no longer be performed~(see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory-observables}). 





%##############################################
\section{Observables}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-observables}

A particle scattering process or decay is fully characterized by the initial and final state particles as well as the interactions between them. Typical experimental observables are inclusive and differential cross sections as well as decay rates which can be calculated using perturbation theory. The cornerstone of such a calculation is the \glshere{smatrix} which describes the transition probability of a system from an initial to a final multiparticle state as $|\langle i|\mathcal{S}|f\rangle|^{2}\,$. In the Heisenberg picture the \gls{smatrix} is given by the Dyson series

\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}&=\mathrm{T}\Big[\exp\Big(-i\int\mathrm{d}^{4}x~\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}(t)\Big)\Big]\nonumber\\
&=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-i)^{n}}{n!}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}^{4}x_{1}\ldots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}^{4}x_{n}~\mathrm{T}\Big[\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}(t_{1})\ldots\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}(t_{n})\Big]\,, \label{eq:theory-dyson-series}
\end{align}

where particle interactions are described within the non-free part of the Hamiltonian density $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}=\mathcal{H}-\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{free}\,$. The operator $\mathrm{T}$ ensures that products of $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}(t_{i})$ are ordered by time. The transition amplitude from an initial to a final multiparticle state with particles $\psi_i^\mathrm{in/out}$ respectively is then given by

\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{in\to out}&=\langle\psi_{1}^\mathrm{out}\ldots\psi_{N^{\prime}}^\mathrm{out}\,|\,\mathcal{S}\,|\,\psi_{1}^\mathrm{in}\ldots\psi_{N}^\mathrm{in}\rangle \\
&=\underbrace{\langle\psi_{1}^\mathrm{out}\ldots\psi_{N^{\prime}}^\mathrm{out}\,|\,\psi_{1}^\mathrm{in}\ldots\psi_{N}^\mathrm{in}\rangle}_\mathrm{no~interaction}~+~i\mathcal{M}\,(2\pi)^{4}\delta^{4}\big(\Sigma p^\mathrm{in}_{i}-\Sigma p^\mathrm{out}_{j}\big)
\end{align}

where the \glshere{me}, denoted $\mathcal{M}$, captures the interaction terms at all orders of the perturbative series. If $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}>1$ the series does not converge and one says the problem is not solvable perturbatively. For instance, the ground states of hadrons can not be calculated perturbatively because of the running of the strong coupling constant. An alternative approach based on lattice gauge theory allowed to solve this problem~\cite{Durr:2008zz}. 

For a scattering process, given a flux $L=\rho v$ of incoming particles with density $\rho$ and velocity $v$, the cross section $\sigma$ is defined as the number of interactions per unit density~($\rho=1$). It is usually denoted in the unit ``barn''~[$\mathrm{b}$] which is defined as $1~\mathrm{b}\equiv 10^{-28}~\mathrm{m}^{2}\,$.  The number of interaction events per time is given by $\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}t=L\sigma\,$. The flux $L$ is commonly referred to as luminosity. In the case of hadron-hadron collisions the total cross section can be calculated from the partonic cross section $\sigma(f_{i}f_{j}\to X)$ for a given process  as

\begin{equation}
\sigma(\mathrm{pp}\to X)=\sum_{i,j}\iint\mathrm{d}x_{1}\,\mathrm{d}x_{2}~\mathrm{PDF}(x_{1},f_{i})\,\mathrm{PDF}(x_{2},f_{j})\,\sigma(f_{i}f_{j}\to X)\,,
\end{equation}

where additional summations and integrations over the \glspl{pdf} are required to account for the individual contributions per incoming parton flavor $f_{i}$ and momentum fraction $x_{i}\,$.

Cross sections can be written in terms of the number of interaction vertices contributing to $\mathcal{M}$ originating from elements of the perturbative series~(Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-dyson-series}). This allows to the expand them as a power series in terms of the coupling constant $\alpha$ as

\begin{equation}
\sigma=\sigma_\mathrm{\gls{lo}}\cdot\Big(1+\Big(\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\Big)\cdot\sigma_\mathrm{1}+\Big(\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\Big)^2\cdot\sigma_{2}+\Big(\frac{\alpha}{2\pi}\Big)^{3}\cdot\sigma_{3}+\ldots\Big)\,.
\end{equation}

Depending at which term the series is cut off one speaks of \glshere{lo}, \glshere{nlo}, or \glshere{nnlo} accuracy in $\alpha$. In general, it is desirable to calculate observables beyond \gls{lo}. Predictions including higher order corrections tend to be less affected by theoretical uncertainties which originate from a variation of the chosen renormalization and factorization scales\footnote{Partonic \gls{lo} cross sections (without loops) can only be monotonous functions of $\mu_\mathrm{R}$ since $\sigma\propto\alpha(\mu_\mathrm{R})$\,. Hence an uncertainty due to a scale variation can be even considered meaningless.}.

The optical theorem, which can be derived from the unitarity of the \gls{smatrix} ($\mathcal{S}^{\dagger}\mathcal{S}=1$), states that the imaginary part of a forward scattering amplitude $\mathcal{M}(i\to f)$ is directly related to the total scattering amplitude of producing all possible intermediate particles $\sum_{X}\mathcal{M}^\dagger(i/f\to X)$ from the initial or final state. Since a total cross section is at least as big as the single forward scattering cross section one finds that the matrix elements $\mathcal{M}$ are bound and cannot be arbitrary large. Nonetheless, a theory may describe experimental data well but violate the unitarity bound at higher energies. Such a case would hint towards a new physics model which restores unitarity by introducing new particles or interactions above the experimentally probable energy regime. This is called \glshere{uv} completion. Hence, a unitarity-violating theory may just reflect the low energy limit of an unknown \gls{uv}-complete theory. Exemplary, the $\mathrm{W}^{\rmplus}\mathrm{W}^{\rmminus}\to\mathrm{W}^{\rmplus}\mathrm{W}^{\rmminus}$ scattering amplitude would grow as $\mathcal{M}\sim s/m_\mathrm{W}^2$ if there is no Higgs boson and eventually violate unitarity at $\sqrt{s}\approx1~\TeV$.

\section{Open questions}
%##############################################

The \gls{sm} is believed to be not the final theory describing fundamental interactions. In the following some of its problems are briefly outlined.

\begin{description}
\item[Gravity] The \gls{sm} cannot describe gravitational interactions. The mediator of gravity, the graviton, would have to be a spin~2 boson which however leads non-renormalizable divergences. At energy scales reached by colliders, it is fine nonetheless to ignore gravitational interactions since those become only comparable in strength to the electroweak and strong interactions at the Planck scale which is $\mathcal{O}(10^{18}~\GeV)$ if there are no extra dimensions.
\item[Naturalness] A large correction to the bare Higgs boson mass originates from top quark loops via Yukawa interactions. Those need to be absorbed by the physical Higgs mass through renormalization. The resulting mass can be written as $m^{2}_\mathrm{H}\approx (m^\mathrm{bare}_\mathrm{H})^2+\lambda_\mathrm{t}^{2}\mu^2/(16\pi^2)\,$. If the \gls{sm} is valid up to the Planck scale it would require an extraordinary fine-tuning of the bare Higgs mass in order to cancel this large correction. Such a coincidence is considered to be not very ``natural''.
\item[Dark matter and dark energy] Cosmological observations of rotation speeds of galaxies, mapping of matter distributions through micro-lensing, and acoustic oscillations in the cosmic microwave background suggest that there exists a yet unidentified kind of matter, called ``dark matter''. An even more puzzling building block of the universe which is missing from the \gls{sm} is dark energy. It is a crucial ingredient to describe the expansion of the universe.

\end{description}
