An introduction to the \gls{sm}, its particle content, interactions, and properties is provided in the following. Special focus is attributed to the top quark which is the heaviest known fundamental particle to date. Here, latest experimental results are discussed and the theoretical foundation of the measurements within this thesis is laid out.

\section{General quantum field theory of the Standard Model}
%##############################################

The \gls{sm} describes the interactions between fundamental particles. It is based on \gls{qft} which allows to predict observables of particle interactions. Exemplary observables are production cross sections or decay rates of particles which can be calculated within its framework -- even fully automatized. The \gls{sm} validity is constantly challenged by comparing predictions to experimental data. No significant deviations have been found so far that would hint towards physics \gls{bsm}.

\subsection{Particle content}
%##############################################

Fundamental particles are objects for which experiments have revealed no internal structure. For example, only an upper limit on the spatial radius of an electron has been measured to be $<10^{-18}~\mathrm{m}$~\cite{PhysRevLett.97.030801}. Such particles are therefore considered as point-like. Fundamental particles can be grouped by their spin into fermions with spin~$\frac{1}{2}$ and bosons with integer spin. The fermions can be further divided into leptons and quarks where only the later can participate in strong interactions. Tables~\ref{tab:theory-leptons} and~\ref{tab:theory-quarks} list the leptons and quarks respectively. Each column is called a generation. It encapsulates an isospin pair whose components are therefore also referred to as up- or down-type respectively. It is unknown why there are exactly three lepton and three quark generations. Atoms forming ordinary matter consist of only particles from the first generation: electrons, protons, and neutrons, where the later two are bound states of uud quarks and udd quarks respectively.\todo{mention searches for 4th generation?}

For the neutrinos masses, only upper limits on their masses are given. Those are derived by combining measurements of beta decay kinematics with results from neutrino oscillation experiments. In the \gls{sm}, neutrinos are assumed to be massless. However, the observation \todo{need ref} of neutrino oscillations requires that at least two neutrinos have a non-zero mass.

The bosons are connected to fundamental interactions by requiring invariance under a gauge group transformation as explained later in this chapter. They are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-bosons}. All bosons except the Higgs boson carry a spin of~$1$. The Higgs boson is the only scalar particle~(spin~$0$) of the \gls{sm}. For a long time, it was a purely hypothetical particle of the \gls{sm}. In July 2012, the ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2012tfa} and CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj} collaborations independently reported an observation of a Higgs-like particle. Further investigations whether this new particle exhibits the expected interactions with other particles revealed that it is consistent with the \gls{sm} Higgs boson~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau}. This discovery completed the \gls{sm} and thus gave further confidence into its theoretical foundation.

Each fundamental particle has additionally a charge-conjugated partner called antiparticle. Other properties such as mass are identical. The photon, Z boson, and Higgs boson are their own antiparticle. It is still under study if the neutrino is its own antiparticle. Fermions with such a property are called Majorana particles~\cite{Majorana2006}. Experimentally, this can be probed in double $\beta$ decays~($\mathrm{nn}\to\mathrm{pp}+\mathrm{e}^{\rmminus}\mathrm{e}^{\rmminus}\nu_\mathrm{e}\nu_\mathrm{e}$) where in the case of Majorana neutrinos the decay can occur without emitting two neutrinos. However, this scenario seems to be disfavored by recent results as reviewed in Ref.~\cite{Dell'Oro:2016dbc}.

\subsection{Quantum field theory}
%##############################################

In the framework of \gls{qft}, particles are described as excitation modes of quantized fields. This is also referred to as ``second quantization'' allowing to describe many-particle systems. Field operators can be decomposed as

\begin{align}
    \hat{\psi}(x)&=\sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N}}u_{i}(x)\hat{a}_{i} \\
    \hat{\psi}^{\dagger}(x)&=\sum_{i}^{\mathrm{N}}u^{\star}_{i}(x)\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{i},
\end{align}

where $u_{i}(x)$ denotes the ordinary wave function of a single particle and $\hat{a}^{\dagger}_{i}$ ($\hat{a}_{i}$) its creation (annihilation) operator, respectively.

As in classical mechanics, the action of a system can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
S=\int\mathrm{L}\,\mathrm{d}t=\iint\mathcal{L}\,\mathrm{d}^{3}\vec{x}\,\mathrm{dt}=\int\mathcal{L}\,\mathrm{d}^{4}x
\end{equation}

with the Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$. For example, a system of free fermions is described by the Dirac Lagrangian density,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:theory-diracL}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Dirac}=\bar{\psi}\big(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m\big)\psi
\end{equation}

using the definitions $\partial_\mu\equiv\partial/\partial x_\mu$ and $\bar{\psi}\equiv\psi^\dagger\gamma^{0}$ where $\gamma_\mu$ denote the Dirac matrices\footnote{Multiple representations are possible. The matrices need to satisfy a Clifford algebra with the anticommutation relation: $\big\{\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu\big\}=\gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu+\gamma^\nu\gamma^\mu=2g^{\mu\nu}$.}. The principle of least action, $\delta \mathrm{S}=0$, that is satisfied by the Euler-Lagrange equation yields the equation of motion as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bar{\psi}}-\frac{\partial}{\partial_\mu}\Bigg(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\big(\partial_\mu\bar{\psi}\big)}\Bigg)=\big(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m\big)\psi=0. \\
\end{equation}

Assuming $\psi\propto e^{-ip^{\mu}x_{\mu}}$ leads directly to the well-known energy-momentum equivalence

\begin{align}
0&=\big(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m\big)\cdot \big(-i\gamma^\nu\partial_\nu-m\big)\psi\\
 &=\big(\partial^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}+m^{2}\big)\psi \qquad \mathrm{(``Klein\mbox{-}Gordan''~equation)}  \\
 &\Rightarrow \big(-p^{\mu}p_{\mu}+m^{2}\big) = 0.
\end{align}


In the \gls{sm}, interactions between particles are introduced by requiring local invariance of the Lagrangian density for certain groups of gauge transformations. In the following, this is briefly demonstrated for the case of a $\mathrm{U(1)}$ transformation which leads to electromagnetic interactions.

The transformation of Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-diracL} using 

\begin{equation}
\psi(x)\mapsto\psi^{\prime}(x)=\psi\exp^{-iq\alpha(x)}
\end{equation}

where the phase $\alpha(x)$ depends on the local coordinates $x$ yields

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\psi,\partial_\mu\psi)\mapsto\mathcal{L}(\psi^{\prime},\partial_\mu\psi^{\prime})=\bar{\psi}\big(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu+q\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\alpha(x)-m\big)\psi.
\end{equation}

The invariance $\mathcal{L}(\psi,\partial_\mu\psi)=\mathcal{L}(\psi^{\prime},\partial_\mu\psi^{\prime})$ is restored by adding a bosonic spin-1 field $A_{\mu}(x)$ which interacts with $\psi$ while transforming as

\begin{equation}
A_{\mu}(x)\mapsto A^{\prime}_{\mu}(x)=A_\mu(x)-\partial_\mu\alpha(x).
\end{equation}

This procedure yields a Lagrangian density containing the following terms:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}=~~&\bar{\psi}\big(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m\big)\psi &(\mathrm{fermion~propagator}) \\
            +&q\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi A_{\mu} &(\mathrm{interaction}) \label{eq:theory-EM-int}\\
            -&\tfrac{1}{4}\big(\partial_\mu A_\nu-\partial_\nu A_\mu\big)^{2} &(\mathrm{boson~propagator})
\end{align}

The boson propagator describing the dynamics of a free $A_\mu$ field has been added additionally to the Lagrangian density. It is already invariant under the local gauge transformation. The introduced interaction~(Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-EM-int}) which is required to ensure the invariance under $\mathrm{U(1)}$ transformation can be identified as electromagnetic interaction between a fermion described by $\psi$ with electric charge $q$ and a photon described by $A_\mu$. Furthermore, the photon is predicted to be massless since adding a term of the form $m^{2}_{A}A^\mu A_\mu$ would violate the invariance.

Other interactions of the \gls{sm} are also connected to local gauge transformations which can be introduced through similar procedures. A common property follows from the Noether theorem which states that for each continuous transformation a conserved current exists. Hence the charge associated to each gauge group is conserved. This would however be already the case for a global transformation. The requirement of invariance under an even local gauge transformations is a puzzling feature of the theory. \todo{ref to some philosophical arguments? is there an implication from renormalization?}

%##############################################
\subsection{Electroweak interactions and Higgs mechanism}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-ewk}

Electromagnetic and weak interactions can be unified using a $\mathrm{U(1)}\otimes \mathrm{SU(2)}$ gauge group. Furthermore, the theory needs to account for the following features found experimentally.

\begin{itemize}

\item Parity is not conserved in weak interactions. Such interactions depend on the spin being aligned towards or against the momentum of a particle. Experimentally, the Wu experiment~\cite{PhysRev.105.1413} discovered this feature in ${}_{27}^{60}\mathrm{Co}\to{}_{28}^{60}\mathrm{Ni}+e^{\rmminus}\bar{\nu}_{e}\gamma\gamma$ decays by analyzing the direction of the electron with respect to the polarization of the cobalt probe through an external magnetic field. 

\item The UA1 and UA2 experiments at the CERN SPS proton-antiproton collider discovered that \wboson bosons~\cite{Arnison:1983rp,Banner:1983jy} and \zboson bosons~\cite{Arnison:1983mk,Bagnaia:1983zx} -- mediators of weak interactions -- are massive. The masses of these particles have to be introduced in a different way if the concept of local gauge invariance should continue to hold.

\end{itemize}

To account for the violation of parity, fermion fields have to be first decomposed into chiral eigenstates using the projections

\begin{align}
\psi_\mathrm{L}&\equiv\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{L}\psi=\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\gamma_{5})\psi \\
\psi_\mathrm{R}&\equiv\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{R}\psi=\tfrac{1}{2}(1+\gamma_{5})\psi
\end{align}

with $\gamma_{5}=i\gamma_{0}\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}\gamma_{3}$\footnote{Properties: $(\gamma_{5})^{\dagger}=\gamma_{5}$; ~~$(\gamma_{5})^2=\mathrm{I}_\mathrm{4x4}$; ~~ $\{\gamma_{5},\gamma_{\mu}\}=\gamma_{5}\gamma_{\mu}+\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}=0$.} where $\psi_\mathrm{L}$ ($\psi_\mathrm{R}$) is called ``left-handed'' (``right-handed'') respectively. In the case of massless particles, Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-diracL} decouples into two independent equations for $\psi_\mathrm{L}$ and $\psi_\mathrm{R}$. Here, the chirality is equal to the Lorentz-invariant helicity

\begin{equation}
H=\frac{\vec{p}\cdot\vec{s}}{|\vec{p}|}
\end{equation}

which denotes whether the spin $\vec{s}$ is aligned along~($H=+1$) or against~($H=-1$) the momentum axis. For massive particles, Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-diracL} cannot be decomposed since chirality is not Lorentz invariant. \todo{CP is violated}\todo{add that CPT is considered invariant}

The Glawhow-Weinberg-Salam model~\cite{Salam:1964ry,Weinberg:1967tq,Glashow:1961tr} splits the fermion fields into ``left-handed'' doublets 

\begin{align}
\vec{\mathrm{E}}_\mathrm{L}&=\Bigg\{\colvec{2}{\nu_\mathrm{e,L}}{e^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{L}},\colvec{2}{\nu_{\mu,\mathrm{L}}}{\mu^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{L}},\colvec{2}{\nu_{\tau,\mathrm{L}}}{\tau^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{L}}\Bigg\} \label{eq:theory-su2-leptons} \\
\vec{\mathrm{Q}}_\mathrm{L}&=\Bigg\{\colvec{2}{\mathrm{u}_\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{d}_\mathrm{L}},\colvec{2}{\mathrm{c}_\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{s}_\mathrm{L}},\colvec{2}{\mathrm{t}_\mathrm{L}}{\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{L}}\Bigg\} \label{eq:theory-su2-quarks}
\end{align}

and ``right-handed'' singlets 

\begin{align}
\vec{\mathrm{e}}_\mathrm{R}=\big\{\mathrm{e}^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{R},\mu^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{R},\tau^{\rmminus}_\mathrm{R}\big\},\quad\vec{\mathrm{u}}_\mathrm{R}=\big\{\mathrm{u}_\mathrm{R},\mathrm{c}_\mathrm{R},\mathrm{t}_\mathrm{R}\big\},\quad\vec{\mathrm{d}}_\mathrm{R}=\big\{\mathrm{d}_\mathrm{R},\mathrm{s}_\mathrm{R},\mathrm{b}_\mathrm{R}\big\}
\end{align}

of the $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ group. Right-handed neutrinos do not participate in any interaction within the \gls{sm}\todo{they could if massive?}. The gauge transformation of the combined group is

\begin{equation}
\psi\mapsto\psi\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-ig\vec{\alpha}(x)\cdot\vec{\omega}/2}\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-ig^{\prime}\beta(x)/2} \label{eq:theory-u1su2-transformation}
\end{equation}

where $\omega_{a}$~($a\in\{1,2,3\}$) denote the Pauli matrices and $g$, $g^{\prime}$ the corresponding conserved charges. This leads to four boson fields, $W^{a}_{\mu}$ and $B_{\mu}$, that interact with the fermions. Hence in analogy to Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-EM-int} one obtains

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{interaction}=~~\sum_{\psi_\mathrm{L}}^\mathrm{doublets}&\bar{\psi}^{i}_\mathrm{L}~\gamma^{\mu}\big(\tfrac{1}{2}g\vec{W}_{\mu}\cdot\vec{\omega}+\tfrac{1}{2}g^{\prime}B_{\mu}\big)\psi^{i}_\mathrm{L} \\
+\sum_{\psi^{i}_\mathrm{R}}^\mathrm{singlets}&\bar{\psi}^{i}_\mathrm{R}~\gamma^{\mu}\tfrac{1}{2}g^{\prime}B_{\mu}\psi^{i}_\mathrm{R} + \mathrm{\gls{hc}}
\end{align}
\todo{is it correct that singlets do not couple to A?}

where the summation is implied over the fermion doublets and singlets. The coupling structure $\propto(\gamma_{\mu}-\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5})$ between $W_{\mu}^{a}$ and $\psi$ is called a \gls{va} structure because of its spatial transformation properties. \todo{elaborate more! e.g. antiparticle} and obeys the observation of the Wu experiment.

Unfortunately, a fermion mass term $\propto m_\mathrm{f}\bar{\psi}_\mathrm{f}\psi_\mathrm{f}=m_\mathrm{f}(\bar{\psi}_\mathrm{f,L}\psi_\mathrm{f,R}+\bar{\psi}_\mathrm{f,R}\psi_\mathrm{f,L})$ cannot be added to the Lagrangian density since it is not invariant under $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ transformation. To introduce mass terms for fermions and the \wboson/\zboson gauge bosons, a solution is provided by the Englert-Brout-Higgs-Guralnik-Hagen-Kibble-mechanism~\cite{HIGGS1964132,PhysRevLett.13.508,PhysRevLett.13.321,PhysRevLett.13.585}. A new scalar $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ doublet field $\phi=(\phi^{\rmplus},\phi^{0})$\footnote{$\phi^{\rmplus}$ annihilates positively charge scalar particles / creates antiparticles with negative charge; $\phi^{0}$ annihilates neutral particles / creates neutral antiparticles.} -- invariant under $\mathrm{U(1)}\otimes\mathrm{SU(2)}$ -- is added to the Lagrangian density

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\phi}&=\big(D_{\mu}\phi^{\dagger}\big)\big(D^{\mu}\phi\big)+\mathrm{V}(\phi) \label{eq:theory-phi-propagator} \\
D^{\mu}\phi&=\big(\partial^{\mu}+\tfrac{1}{2}ig\vec{W}^{\mu}\cdot\vec{\omega}+\tfrac{1}{2}ig^{\prime}B^{\mu}\big)\phi \label{eq:theory-phi-codev}
\end{align}

which interacts with the gauge bosons. In addition, $\phi$ has a potential 

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{V}(\phi)=-\mu^2\phi^\dagger\phi+\tfrac{1}{2}\lambda(\phi^\dagger\phi)^2
\end{equation}

in the form of a ``Mexcian hat'' as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-higgs-potential} that leads to a \gls{vev} of $\phi_0=\sqrt{\mu^{2}/\lambda}\equiv v/\sqrt{2}$ for $\mu^2>0$.

\myfigure{\label{fig:theory-higgs-potential}The ``Mexican hat'' potential of the Higgs field with a non-zero \gls{vev} $\phi_0$ which leads to symmetry breaking.}{
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/theory/higgspot.pdf}
}

One says that this shifted \gls{vev} ``breaks'' the $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ symmetry when parameterizing $\phi$ around the minimum as

\begin{equation}
\phi(x) \big|_{\phi_0} = \colvec{2}{0}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(v+h(x)\big)}\cdot \mathrm{e}^{-i\vec{\theta}(x)\cdot\vec{\omega}/(2v)} \label{eq:theory-phi-dev}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{\theta}$ denotes three so-called ``Goldstone'' bosons and $h$ the Higgs boson. In fact, the symmetry still exists but is ``hidden''. A $\mathrm{SU(2)}$ transformation, called ``unitary'' gauge, can be performed such that $\vec{\theta}$ vanishes. One says that these three Goldstone bosons and their degrees of freedom are ``eaten'' by the \wboson and \zboson bosons to become massive and hence can have also a longitudinal polarization. After the gauge transformation, the Higgs boson remains. The parametrization is chosen such that it leaves the minimum invariant under the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ subgroup transformation

\begin{equation}
\phi\mapsto\phi\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-ig\alpha_{3}(x)\omega_{3}/2}\cdot\mathrm{e}^{-ig^{\prime}\beta(x)/2}. \label{eq:theory-broken-u1-trans}
\end{equation}

Inserting Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-phi-dev} into Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-phi-propagator} yields the following non-interaction terms

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Higgs}&=~~~\tfrac{1}{2}(\partial_{\mu}h^{\dagger})(\partial^{\mu}h)-\lambda^2 v^2 h^2 \label{eq:theory-higgs} \\
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{W_1,W_2~bosons}&=-\tfrac{1}{8}g^2 v^2 \big(W_{1,\mu} W_{1}^{\mu}+W_{2,\mu} W_{2}^{\mu}\big) \label{eq:theory-a1a2} \\
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{W_3,B~bosons}&=-\tfrac{1}{8}v^2 \big(gW_{3,\mu}-g^{\prime}B_\mu\big)\big(gW_{3}^{\mu}-g^{\prime}B^\mu\big) \label{eq:theory-a3b}.
\end{align}
\todo{add propagators for W and B or remove propagator for h and call it mass terms}

The first term (Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-higgs}) describes a free scalar boson, the Higgs boson \higgs, with mass $m=\lambda v$. Next, the $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$
fields in Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-a1a2} can be identified as a particle/antiparticle pair $\wboson=1/\sqrt{2}(W_1\mp iW_2)$ with mass $m_{\wboson}=\frac{1}{2}gv$. Lastly, the fields $W_3$ and $B$ appear to be in a mixed mass state~(Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-a3b}). By performing a rotation of the couplings

\begin{equation}
\colvec{2}{\zboson}{A}=\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta_\mathrm{W} & -\sin\theta_\mathrm{W} \\
\sin\theta_\mathrm{W} & \cos\theta_\mathrm{W}
\end{pmatrix}
\colvec{2}{W_{3}}{B},\quad \cos\theta_\mathrm{W}=\frac{g}{\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime 2}}},
\end{equation}

where $\theta_\mathrm{W}$ is called the ``weak-mixing'' or ``Weinberg'' angle, another massive boson $\zboson$ with mass $m_\zboson=v\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime2}}/2$ and a massless boson $A_\mu$, the photon, can be identified. The angle is determined as $\sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W} \approx 0.2312$ through the mass ratio $m_\wboson/m_\zboson=\cos\theta_\mathrm{W}$. Rewriting the covariant derivative of Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-phi-codev} into these mass eigenstates yields

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}=&~~~~\partial_\mu+i\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\big(W^{\rmplus}_\mu T^{\rmplus}+W^{\rmminus}_\mu T^{\rmminus})\\
&-i\frac{g^2T_3-g^{\prime 2}Y}{\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime 2}}}\cdot\zboson_\mu-i\frac{g^{\prime}g\big(T^3+Y\big)}{\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime 2}}}\cdot A_\mu
\end{align}

where $T^{\pm}$ denote the ladder operators, $Y$ the $\mathrm{U(1)}$ so-called ``hyper'' charge and $T_3$ the $\mathrm{SU(2)}$  charge. From the coupling to the photon one can read of the electric coupling constant to be 

\begin{equation}
e=\frac{g^{\prime} g}{\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime 2}}}~,\quad \aem=\frac{e^2}{4\pi}=\frac{1}{137}
\end{equation}

and the corresponding electric charge to be $Q=T_3+Y$ which is invariant under Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-broken-u1-trans}. For the weak coupling constant one finds the relation $e=g\cdot\sin\theta_\mathrm{W}$ which yields $\aw=\aem/\sin^2\theta_\mathrm{W}\approx0.03157.$

In conclusion, starting from a local gauge invariant theory, the procedure of symmetry breaking through a shifted \gls{vev} leads to three Goldstone bosons which are absorbed into mass terms for the \wboson and \zboson bosons. The value of the \gls{vev} can be determined from the Fermi coupling constant, measured in muon decays, as $v = (\sqrt{2}\mathrm{G_{F}})^{-1/2}\approx 246~\GeV$~\cite{PhysRevLett.106.041803}. Additionally, the Higgs boson is predicted which was discovered in July 2012 independently by the ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2012tfa} and CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj} collaborations and thus completing the electroweak theory.


Fermion masses can be generated through Yukawa interactions as

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Yukawa~lepton~int.}=&-\lambda_{e}^{ii}\cdot\bar{\mathrm{E}}^{i}_\mathrm{L}\phi\cdot\mathrm{e}^{i}_\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{\gls{hc}} \label{eq:theory-lepton-yukawa}\\
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Yukawa~quark~int.}=&-\lambda_{d}^{ij}\cdot\bar{\mathrm{Q}}^{i}_\mathrm{L}\phi\cdot\mathrm{d}^{j}_\mathrm{R}-\lambda_{u}^{ik}\cdot\bar{\mathrm{Q}}^{i}_\mathrm{L}\epsilon^{ij}\phi\cdot\mathrm{u}^{k}_\mathrm{R} +\mathrm{\gls{hc}} \label{eq:theory-quark-yukawa}
\end{align}

where the coupling strengths are denoted by $\lambda$. A mass term for the electron, muon and tau lepton of $m_l=-\lambda_l v/\sqrt{2}$ can be identified after the symmetry breaking. The quarks can be disentangled from their mixed mass state through a rotation of the fields 

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{u}^{\prime i}_\mathrm{L}=U^{ij}_\mathrm{u}\mathrm{u}^{j}_\mathrm{L},\quad \mathrm{d}^{\prime i}_\mathrm{L}=U^{ij}_\mathrm{d}\mathrm{d}^{j}_\mathrm{L}
\end{equation}

which allows to write the Lagrangian density in the quark mass eigenstates. This rotation leads to an interaction 

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\wboson~\mathrm{interaction}}=\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{\mathrm{u}}^{\prime i}_\mathrm{L}\gamma^{\mu}\underbrace{(U^\dagger_\mathrm{u}U_\mathrm{d})_{ij}}_{=\mathrm{V}_{ij}}\mathrm{d}^{\prime j}_\mathrm{R} W^{\rmplus}_\mu+\mathrm{\gls{hc}}
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{V}_{ij}$ is the \gls{ckm} matrix. \todo{add matrix from pdg?} \todo{comment on free parameters: masses, couplings, and custodial symmetry etc}

\subsection{Strong interactions}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-qcd}

The theory of \gls{qcd} describes the strong interaction occurring between quarks. It is connected to a $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ gauge group resulting into the Lagrangian density of

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{\gls{qcd}}=\bar{\psi}i\gamma^{\mu}\big(\partial_{\mu}-ig\vec{G}_\mu\vec{\lambda}\big)\psi-\tfrac{1}{4}\vec{G}_{\mu\nu}\vec{G}^{\mu\nu},\quad \psi=\colvec{3}{\psi_\mathrm{red}}{\psi_\mathrm{green}}{\psi_\mathrm{blue}}
\end{align}

which is invariant under the transformation

\begin{equation}
\psi\mapsto\psi\mathrm{e}^{-ig\vec{\alpha}(x)\vec{\lambda}}.
\end{equation}

The fields $\vec{G}_\mu$ describe eight gluons which represent the massless gauge bosons of the group. The conserved charge of the group is called ``color'' (red, green, blue) which is however equal in strength for all charges. The generators $\lambda_a$~($a\in{1\ldots8}$) obey the relation $[\lambda_a,\lambda_b]=if_{abc}\lambda^c$ with the antisymmetric structure constant $f_{abc}$. A common representation of $\vec{\lambda}$ is given by the Gell-Mann matrices. The non-abelian group structure leads to gluon self-interactions through the gluon field strength tensor

\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu}^{a}=\partial_{\mu} G_\nu^{a}-\partial_{\nu} G_{\mu}^{a}+gf^{abc}G_{\mu,b}G_{\nu,c}.
\end{equation}

No free quarks can exist in nature because of a phenomenon called ``color-confinement''. The \gls{qcd} potential between two quarks can be approximated as a ``Coulomb-plus-linear'' potential~\cite{Sumino2003173}

\begin{equation}
V(r)=-\frac{4\cdot\as}{3r}+k\cdot r
\end{equation}

where at large distances $r$ or equivalently small energies a linear term dominates. The factor $k$ can be understood as a ``gluon-spring'' tension similar to that of a harmonic oscillator. New quark / antiquark pairs can be created from the vacuum if the gluon field energy exceeds the mass of the new pair. This can lead to a cascade of new particles emerging from the gluon field at sufficiently large energies which binds ``free'' quarks into color-neutral singlets called hadrons. Such a process is referred to as hadronization. In experiments, one usually clusters collimated jets of particles to infer the momentum of a quark candidate.

Hadrons can be either mesons which consist of quark-antiquark pairs~($\bar{\mathrm{q}}\mathrm{q}$) or baryons consisting of quark triplets~($\mathrm{qqq}$). These constituents of a hadron are referred to as ``valence quarks''. Common mesons are the pions $\pi^{\rmplus}$~($\mathrm{u}\bar{\mathrm{d}}$), $\pi^{0}$~($(\mathrm{u}\bar{\mathrm{u}}-\mathrm{d}\bar{\mathrm{d}})/\sqrt{2}$), kaons $\mathrm{K}^{\rmplus}$~($\mathrm{u}\bar{\mathrm{s}}$), $\mathrm{K}^{0}$~($\mathrm{d}\bar{\mathrm{s}}$) and $\mathrm{J}/\Psi$~($\mathrm{c}\bar{\mathrm{c}}$). Typical baryons are the proton~($\mathrm{uud}$), the neutron~($\mathrm{udd}$), and~$\Lambda^{0}$~($\mathrm{uds}$). In 2003, a new bound state containing four quarks has been observed by the Belle experiment~\cite{PhysRevLett.91.262001} at \gls{kek}, Japan. The \gls{lhcb} experiment at the \gls{lhc}, \gls{cern} confirmed this observation in 2013~\cite{Aaij:2013zoa} followed by the discovery of more so-called ``tetraquark'' candidates~\cite{Aaij:2014jqa,Aaij:2016iza} and even ``pentaquarks'' forming a bound state of five quarks~\cite{Aaij:2015tga}.\todo{balance tetraquarks/pentaquarks, ref to review?}

Besides valence quarks, gluons and so-called ``sea quarks'' from spontaneous gluon splittings~($\mathrm{g}\to\bar{\mathrm{q}}\mathrm{q}$) are considered constituents of a hadron as well. This whole group of particles is commonly referred to as partons. In hadron collision experiments at a sufficiently high momentum transfer, one can approximate all partons as free which allows to treat hadron--hadron scattering as a single parton--parton interaction instead~\cite{Feynman:1969wa}. The momentum of a parton is expressed as a fraction of the hadron momentum $\vec{p}_\mathrm{parton}=x\cdot \vec{p}_\mathrm{hadron}$. Then, the probability of 
finding two parton flavors $f_{i}$ with momentum fraction $x_{i}$ interacting at an energy scale $\mu_\mathrm{F}$ is given by the \gls{pdf} as $\mathrm{PDF}(x_{1},f_{1},\mu_\mathrm{F})\cdot\mathrm{PDF}(x_{2},f_{2},\mu_\mathrm{F})$. The \glspl{pdf} are normalized such that

\begin{equation}
\sum_{f}^\mathrm{partons}\int_{0}^{1}\mathrm{d}x~x\cdot \mathrm{PDF}(x,\mu_\mathrm{F},f)=1
\end{equation}

yields the total momentum of the hadron. The scale $\mu_\mathrm{F}$ is called ``factorization scale'' below which non-perturbative low energy effects such as soft gluon emissions have been absorbed into the \gls{pdf}. Measuring the \glspl{pdf} at scale $\mu_\mathrm{F}$, one can extrapolate them to any other scale by solving the DGLAP\footnote{Named after the authors: Y. Dokshitzer, W. Gribow, L. Lipatow, G. Altarelli, G. Parisi} equation~\cite{Dokshitzer:1977sg,Gribov:1972ri,Altarelli:1977zs}. A review of common \gls{pdf} sets currently used can be found in Ref.~\cite{Accardi2016}. There are various groups estimating \gls{pdf} sets from fits to experimental data using different approaches; e.g. CTEQ, MMHT~(formerly MSTW), ABM, HERAPDF, and NNPDF. Exemplary distributions taken from the NNPDF group~(version 3.0) are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-nnpdf-dist} for $\mu_\mathrm{F}=10~\GeV$ and $\mu_\mathrm{F}=100~\GeV$. More information on this \gls{pdf} set can be found in Ref.~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}. At a momentum fraction of $x\approx0.2$ one can observe two peaks for the up and down quark distributions as expected from the valence quark composition of the proton.

\todo{baryon number B=(nq-nantiq)/3 is conserved}

At high energies, quantum fluctuations lead to divergences as well. In order to let a theory still describe the experimental energy regime, physical quantities are redefined at the so-called ``renormalization scale'' $\mu_\mathrm{R}$. This leads to a ``running'' behavior of the coupling constants as a function of $\mu_\mathrm{R}$. Beyond this scale, high energy effects such as loop corrections of propagators have been absorbed in the physical quantities through renormalization. In particular, the running behavior of the strong coupling constant is found to be 

\begin{equation}
\as(\mu_\mathrm{R})=\frac{\as(\mu_{0}^{2})}{1+\as(\mu_\mathrm{0}^2)\cdot\tfrac{33-2\cdot n_f}{12\pi}\cdot\ln\Big(\tfrac{|\mu_\mathrm{R}^2|}{\mu_{0}^{2}}\Big)}
\end{equation}

where $n_f$ denotes the number of quarks and $\mu_{0}$ is a reference scale where the coupling is known from measurements, e.g. $\mu_{0}=m_{\zboson}$. The world average of the strong coupling constant $\as=g/(4\pi^2)$ at the \zboson boson mass is currently estimated to be $\as(m_{\zboson})=0.1181\pm0.0011$~\cite{Olive:2016xmw}. 

Quarks can be treated as ``asymptotically free'' since the coupling decreases with larger energies. On the other hand, following the behavior of $\as(q^2)$ towards lower energies, a limit $\Lambda_\mathrm{\gls{qcd}}\approx 200~\MeV$ is found at which $\as$ becomes even larger than one. Below such energies, perturbative calculations of observables can no longer be performed. 



%##############################################
\subsection{Observables}
%##############################################

A particle scattering process or decay is characterized by the initial and final particles as well as the interactions between them. Experimental observables are inclusive and differential cross sections as well as decay rates which can be calculated using perturbation theory. 

The cornerstone of such a calculation is the so-called \gls{smatrix} which describes the transition of a system from an initial to a final multiparticle state. In the Heisenberg picture, the time evolution of such a system is given by the Dyson series

\begin{align}
\mathcal{S}&=\mathrm{T}\Big[\exp\Big(-i\int\mathrm{d}^{4}x~\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}(t)\Big)\Big]\\
&=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-i)^{n}}{n!}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}^{4}x_{1}\ldots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathrm{d}^{4}x_{n}~\mathrm{T}\Big[\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}(t_{1})\ldots\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}(t_{n})\Big] \label{eq:theory-dyson-series}
\end{align}

where particle interactions are described within the non-free part of the Hamiltonian density $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}=\mathcal{H}-\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{free}$. The operator $\mathrm{T}$ ensures that products of $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}(t_{i})$ are ordered by time. The transition amplitude from an initial state to a final state with particles $\psi_i^\mathrm{in/out}$ respectively can hence be calculated using

\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{in\to out}&=\langle\psi_{1}^\mathrm{out}\ldots\psi_{N^{\prime}}^\mathrm{out}\,|\,\mathcal{S}\,|\,\psi_{1}^\mathrm{in}\ldots\psi_{N}^\mathrm{in}\rangle \\
&=\langle\psi_{1}^\mathrm{out}\ldots\psi_{N^{\prime}}^\mathrm{out}\,|\,\psi_{1}^\mathrm{in}\ldots\psi_{N}^\mathrm{in}\rangle+i\mathcal{M}\,(2\pi)^{4}\delta^{4}\big(\Sigma p^\mathrm{in}_{i}-\Sigma p^\mathrm{out}_{j}\big)
\end{align}

where $\mathcal{M}$ captures the interaction terms at all orders of the perturbative series. If $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{int}>1$ the series does not converges and one says the problem is not solvable perturbatively. Exemplary, the ground states of hadrons can not be calculated perturbatively because of the running of the strong coupling constant. An alternative approach is required. This problem was solved using lattice gauge theory~\cite{Durr:2008zz}.

The decay rate $\mathrm{d}\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{d}t=\Gamma\cdot\mathrm{N}$ of an unstable particle can be calculated from the width $\Gamma$ which is given by

\begin{align}
\Gamma&=\frac{1}{2m}\sum_\mathrm{out}\int\,\big|\,\mathcal{M}(\mathrm{in}\to\mathrm{out})\,\big|^2\mathrm{d}\Phi^\mathrm{out}\\
\mathrm{d}\Phi^\mathrm{out}&=(2\pi)^{4}\delta^{4}\big(\Sigma p^\mathrm{in}_{i}-\Sigma p^\mathrm{out}_{j}\big)~\prod_{j}\int\frac{\mathrm{d}^{3}~\vec{p}^\mathrm{~out}_{j}}{(2\pi)^{3}2E_{j}^\mathrm{out}}
\end{align}

where $\mathrm{d}\Phi^\mathrm{out}$ integrates over the phase space spanned by the outgoing particle momenta. The $\delta$ function ensures conservation of momentum and energy between the initial and final state. For a decay into a specific final state $f$ one defines the branching ratio as $\mathcal{B}(X\to f)=\Gamma(X \to f)/\sum\Gamma(X \to\mathrm{any})$ where $\sum_{f}\mathcal{B}(X \to f)=1$.

For a scattering process, the cross section $\sigma$ is defined as the number of interactions per unit density~($\rho=1$) given a flux $L=\rho v$ of incoming particles with velocity $v$. It is usually denoted in the unit ``barn''~[$\mathrm{b}$] which is defined as $1~\mathrm{b}\equiv 10^{-28}~\mathrm{m}^{2}$.  The number of interaction events per time is given by $\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}t=L\sigma$. The flux $L$ is commonly referred to as luminosity.

For a collider experiment with beam energies $E_{i}$ and velocities $\vec{v}_{i}$ one finds the cross section as 

\begin{equation}
\sigma=\frac{1}{|\vec{v}_1-\vec{v}_2|}\frac{1}{4E_{1}E_{2}}~\int\,\big|\,\mathcal{M}(\mathrm{in}\to\mathrm{out})\,\big|^{2}~\mathrm{d}\Phi^\mathrm{out}. \label{eq:theory-xsec-calculation}
\end{equation}

In the case of hadron--hadron collisions, Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-xsec-calculation} only calculates the partonic cross section. Exemplary, for the process $\mathrm{pp}\to X$ the total cross section can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
\sigma(\mathrm{pp}\to X)=\sum_{i,j}\iint\mathrm{d}x_{1}\,\mathrm{d}x_{2}~\mathrm{PDF}(x_{1},f_{i})\,\mathrm{PDF}(x_{2},f_{j})\,\sigma(f_{i}f_{j}\to X)
\end{equation}

where additional summations and integrations over the \glspl{pdf} are required to account for the individual contributions per parton flavor $f_{i}$ and per momentum fraction $x_{i}$.



Calculations of observables can be written in terms of the number of interaction vertices contributing to $\mathcal{M}$ originating from the perturbative series~(Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-dyson-series}). This allows to the expand an observable in terms of the coupling constant $\alpha$ as

\begin{equation}
\sigma=\alpha\cdot\sigma_\mathrm{1}+\alpha^{2}\cdot\sigma_{2}+\alpha^{3}\cdot\sigma_{3}+\ldots.
\end{equation}

\todo{what is NNLL?}

Depending at which term the series is cut off one speaks of \gls{lo}, \gls{nlo}, or \gls{nnlo} accuracy in $\alpha$. In general, it is desirable to calculated observables beyond \gls{lo}. Predictions including higher order corrections tend to be less affected by theoretical uncertainties which originate from a variation of the chosen renormalization and factorization scales\footnote{\gls{lo} cross sections can only be monotonous functions of $\mu_\mathrm{R}$ since $\sigma\propto\alpha(\mu_\mathrm{R})$. Hence, an uncertainty due to a scale variation can be even considered meaningless.}.

From the unitarity $\mathcal{S}^{\dagger}\mathcal{S}=1$ of the \gls{smatrix} the optical theorem can be derived. It states that the imaginary part of a scattering amplitude $\mathcal{M}(i\to f)$ is directly related to the scattering amplitude of producing all possible intermediate particles $X$ from the initial times the final state $\sum_{X}\mathcal{M}^\dagger(i\to X)\mathcal{M}(f\to X)$. This leads to general constraints on the total cross section. For example, the scattering amplitude of a $2\to2$ process can be expressed via the optical theorem as

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Im}\Big(\mathcal{M}(\psi_{1}\psi_{2}\to\psi_{1}\psi_{2})\Big)=2\,E_\mathrm{\gls{cm}}|\vec{p}_\mathrm{\gls{cm}}|\sum_{X}\sigma(\psi_{1}\psi_{2}\to X).
\end{equation}

Since the total cross section is at least as big as the scattering cross section $\sigma(\psi_{1}\psi_{2}\to \mathrm{any})>\sigma(\psi_{1}\psi_{2}\to \psi_{1}\psi_{2})$ one finds the constraint

\begin{equation}
\Big|\mathcal{M}(\psi_{1}\psi_{2}\to\psi_{1}\psi_{2})\Big|<64\pi^2.
\end{equation}

Hypothetical, a theory may describe experimental data well but still violates the unitarity bound at higher energies beyond the experimental probing capabilities. Such a case would hint towards a new physics model which restores unitarity by introducing new particles or interactions at energies before it is violated. This is called \gls{uv} completion. A unitarity-violating theory may just reflect the low energy limit of an unknown \gls{uv}-complete theory within the experimental energy regime. Exemplary,  the $\mathrm{W}^{\rmplus}\mathrm{W}^{\rmminus}\to\mathrm{W}^{\rmplus}\mathrm{W}^{\rmminus}$ scattering amplitude would grow as $\mathcal{M}\sim s/m_\wboson^2$ if there is no Higgs boson and eventually violate unitarity at $\sqrt{s}\approx1~\TeV$.

\section{The top quark}
%##############################################

The top quark is the heaviest known fundamental particle so far. Its high mass of $m_\mathrm{t}=173.34\pm0.71~\GeV$~\cite{ATLAS:2014wva} is close to the minimum of the Higgs potential. This implies a Yukawa coupling of $|\lambda_\mathrm{t}|\approx 1$. All other Yukawa couplings are however of the order of $10^{-2}$ instead. The top quark may therefore play an important role in understanding the mechanisms of electroweak symmetry breaking itself. Furthermore, top quarks are excellent probes to search for \gls{bsm} physics. For example, many extensions of the \gls{sm} predict additional $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{Z}^{\prime}$ bosons which are heavier versions of their \gls{sm} counterparts and can interact with top quarks. Other \gls{bsm} models can have an extended Higgs sector leading to additional heavy neutral and charged Higgs bosons which may couple to top quarks predominately due to its high mass~(see Ref.~\cite{Boos:2006xe} and references therein). \todo{find better/more refs} \todo{fcnc}

Historically, the top quark was discovered in 1995 by the \gls{cdf}~\cite{Abe:1995hr} and \gls{d0}~\cite{Abachi:1994td} collaborations at the Tevatron collider at Fermilab using proton-antiproton collision data. The production of top quark pairs which occurs through strong interactions was analyzed. Already before the direct observation of this process, the discovery of the bottom quark~\cite{Augustin:1975yq,PhysRevLett.39.252} and the attempt to explain CP-violation by introducing the \gls{ckm} matrix hinted strongly towards its existence~\cite{Kobayashi01021973} however without knowing its mass. Another milestone was the observation of single top quark production which occurs through electroweak interactions only. This much more rarer process was discovered in 2009 at the Tevatron collider as well~\cite{PhysRevLett.103.092002,PhysRevLett.103.092001}. The lower cross section of this process together with the overwhelming background necessitated the use of sophisticated analysis techniques such as multivariate classifiers and the matrix element method~\cite{Mitrevski}.

With the start of the physics program at the \gls{lhc} in 2010, the production mechanisms of top quarks can be probed with unprecedented precision. This thesis focuses on the production of single top quarks at center-of-mass energies of $8~\TeV$ and $13~\TeV$.


%##############################################
\subsection{Decay properties}
%##############################################

The top quark decays into a W boson and a b quark almost exclusively due to the \gls{ckm} matrix element $\vtb$ which is found experimentally to be $\vtb\gg\vts,\vtd$ and close to 1 as discussed later in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory-exp-results}. The W boson can be on-shell since $m_\wboson<m_\mathrm{top}$ which favors this decay channel via electroweak interactions and leads to a very short lifetime of only $1/\Gamma_\mathrm{t}\approx 5\cdot10^{-25}~\mathrm{s}$~\cite{Olive:2016xmw}. This does not allow the formation of bound states involving top quarks~\cite{BIGI1986157}. Furthermore, the lifetime is even below the typical hadronization timescale of $1/\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}\approx 10^{-23}~\mathrm{s}$. Hence, no soft gluons can radiate from the top quark before it decays which lets its spin stay coherent. The top quark spin orientation can be even inferred from the angular distributions of its decay products since electroweak interactions via $\mathrm{W}$ boson exchange feature a \gls{va} coupling structure. This offers the possibility to study the polarization of top quarks from angular distributions as a pseudo observable in various production processes. For such studies, a spin axis has to been chosen along which the top quark spin is quantized.

Independent of the production process, the polarization states of the \wboson boson can be investigated in the leptonic top quark decay chain $\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{b}\ell\nu$~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2010nx}. For this, the top quark decay width is decomposed into

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\Gamma}{\Gamma\cdot\mathrm{d}\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}}=\tfrac{3}{8}\big(1-\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}\big)^{2}\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}+\tfrac{3}{8}\big(1+\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}\big)^{2}\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}+\tfrac{3}{4}\sin^{2}\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}\mathrm{F}_{0}
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}$, $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}$, and $\mathrm{F}_{0}$ denote the left-, right-handed, and longitudinal polarization fraction respectively. Theses dimensionless form factors are normalized as $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}+\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{F}_{0}=1$. The angle 

\begin{equation}
\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}=\frac{\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}\cdot\vec{p}_{\ell}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}}{\big|\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}\big|\cdot\big|\vec{p}_{\ell}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}\big|}
\end{equation}

is taken between the lepton momentum $\vec{p}_{\ell}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}$ in the W boson rest frame and a spin quantization axis $\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}$. A common choice is the helicity basis where the negative top quark momentum $\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}=-\vec{p}_\mathrm{t}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}$ in the $\mathrm{W}$ boson rest frame is used to quantize the W boson spin\footnote{There are multiple equivalent definitions in literature for the helicity basis: $\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}=-\vec{p}_\mathrm{t}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}=\vec{p}_\mathrm{W}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(t)}}=\vec{p}_\mathrm{b}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}$. It should be noted that multiple sequential boosts into various rest frames are Lorentz-invariant but can induce unwanted rotations.}. Figure~\ref{fig:theory-top-decay} shows the Feynman diagram of leptonic top quark decays involving two electroweak vertices, $\mathrm{Wtb}$ and $\mathrm{W}\ell\nu$, which feature both a \gls{va} coupling structure. The polarization angle in the helicity basis is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-top-whel-angle} where the top quark decay chain is drawn in the W boson rest frame.

Potential scenarios of spin orientations at the $\mathrm{Wtb}$~vertex are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-top-whel-states} drawn in the top quark rest frame for longitudinal~($H=0$), left-handed~($H=-1$), and right-handed~($H=+1$) $\mathrm{W}$~bosons. In the last scenario the conservation of angular momentum forces the $\mathrm{b}$~quark to be right-handed. This is however suppressed by the electroweak \gls{va} coupling structure leading to a nearly vanishing probability at \gls{lo}. It would vanish completely for massless $\mathrm{b}$~quarks since then the $\mathrm{b}$~quark helicity would be equal to its chirality~\cite{Bernreuther:2008ju}.

The expected distributions per helicity state as a function of $\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-whel-distributions} together with the \gls{nnlo} \gls{sm} expectation of $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}=0.311\pm0.005$, $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}=0.0017\pm0.0001$, and $\mathrm{F}_{0}=0.687\pm0.005$~\cite{Czarnecki:2010gb}. The non-zero but small right-handed helicity fraction arises from the non-zero mass of the $\mathrm{b}$~quark and from the considered corrections beyond \gls{lo} to the vertices.

For a general analysis of the top quark spin, one introduces the so-called ``spin-analyzing power'' $\alpha_{X}\in[-1;\,1]$ with respect to the decay product $X=\ell,\nu,\mathrm{W},\mathrm{b}$.\todo{add alphas for had decays} It denotes the fraction of instances when the top quark spin is aligned along the spin analyzer momentum in the top quark rest frame. The calculated spin-analyzing powers at \gls{lo} and \gls{nlo} in the \gls{sm} are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-spin-powers}. For the corresponding particle or antiparticle partner the spin-analyzing power flips its sign. This may however not hold for \gls{bsm} physics inducing CP-violation in the top quark sector. 

The charged lepton is a nearly perfect spin analyzer to study the top quark polarization. It is even larger than the spin-analyzing power of its mother particle, the $\mathrm{W}$~boson, due to constructive (destructive) interference of the longitudinal and left-handed $\mathrm{W}$~boson helicity states in cases when the lepton is aligned (antialigned) with the top quark spin respectively~\cite{Bernreuther:2008ju}.

A simplified sketch of various spin orientations is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-top-spin-orientations} demonstrating that the lepton momentum in the top quark rest frame tends to be aligned along the top quark spin. Antialigned scenarios~(Figs.~\ref{fig:theory-top-spin-orientations-long-suppressed} and~\ref{fig:theory-top-spin-orientations-left-suppressed}) are suppressed by the \gls{va} coupling structure which does not allow right-handed particles~($\nu$) or left-handed antiparticles~($\ell^{\rmplus}$) to interact.

\subsection{Pair production}
%##############################################

The dominant mechanism producing top quarks at hadron colliders is top quark pair production through strong interactions via gluon~($gg\to\ttbar$) or quark fusion~($\mathrm{q}\bar{\mathrm{q}}\to\ttbar$). Figure~\ref{fig:theory-feynman-ttbar} shows the contributing Feynman diagrams at \gls{lo}. Especially the production channel via gluon fusion leads to a large cross section at the \gls{lhc} because of the steeply increasing gluon \gls{pdf} at small momentum fractions. This channel contributes approximately $80\range90\%$ to the total cross section in the \gls{lhc} center-of-mass energy regime of $7\range14~\TeV$~\cite{Olive:2016xmw}.

The theoretical \ttbar cross sections in pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of $8$ and $13~\TeV$, relevant for this thesis, are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-ttbar-xsecs}. Those have been calculated at \gls{nnlo}+NNLL accuracy using the \textsc{Top++}\,2.0 program~\cite{Czakon:2011xx,Czakon:2013goa} assuming a top quark mass of $172.5~\GeV$. The \gls{pdf} uncertainty includes also the uncertainty on \as.

Similar to the study of the $\mathrm{W}$ boson helicity fractions in top quark decays, the polarization of the top quarks arising in pair production can be analyzed by decomposing the \ttbar cross section as a function of the polarization angles. One finds

\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\sigma}{\sigma\cdot\mathrm{d}\cos\theta_{\mathrm{t}X}^\star~\mathrm{d}\cos\theta_{\bar{\mathrm{t}}X^\prime}^\star}=\frac{1}{4}\Big(1&+\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}\,\alpha_{X}\,\cos\theta_{\mathrm{t}X}^\star+\mathrm{P}_{\bar{\mathrm{t}}}\,\alpha_{X^\prime}\,\cos\theta_{\bar{\mathrm{t}}X^\prime}^\star \nonumber \\
&-\mathrm{C}\,\alpha_{X}\alpha_{X^\prime}\,\cos\theta_{\mathrm{t}X}^\star \cos\theta_{\bar{\mathrm{t}}X^\prime}^\star\Big) \label{eq:theory-ttbar-correlation}
\end{align}

where $\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\bar{\mathrm{t}}}$ denote the polarization fractions and $\mathrm{C}$ the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ spin correlation. In the helicity basis, the angles are taken between the momenta of the leptons~($X=\ell^{\rmplus}\,/\,X^\prime=\ell^{\rmminus}$) in the corresponding $\mathrm{t}/\bar{\mathrm{t}}$ rest frames and the momenta of the $\mathrm{t}/\bar{\mathrm{t}}$ in the $\ttbar$ \gls{zmf} respectively. Since the top quarks are produced isotropic at \gls{lo}, only a small net polarization of $\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}=-\mathrm{P}_{\bar{\mathrm{t}}}\approx0.3\%$ for $m_\mathrm{t\bar{t}}>2m_\mathrm{t}$ from electroweak higher order corrections is expected~\cite{Bernreuther:2010ny,Bernreuther:2013aga}. However, the spins of a top quark pair are linked through the $\mathrm{g\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}}$ vertex yielding a large correlation between them~\cite{Mahlon:2010gw}. It depends on the boost of the top quarks with respect to their \gls{zmf} and amounts to $C\approx32\%$ for $m_\mathrm{t\bar{t}}>2m_\mathrm{t}$ at $8~\TeV$~\cite{Bernreuther:2013aga}. Experimentally, the azimuthal $\Delta\phi$ angle between the two leptons in the laboratory frame is sometimes studied instead of the helicity angle. This observable has the advantage that the whole \ttbar system does not need to be reconstructed which involves finding solutions for the two unknown neutrino momenta while matching the two jets with the two leptons to setup two top quark decay chains\footnote{Kinematic fitting is sometimes deployed to solve this problem using the invariant mass of the intermediate top quarks and $\mathrm{W}$~bosons as constraints.}. The amount of correlation cannot be easily extracted from the $\Delta\phi$ distribution directly since its functional form does not resemble Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-ttbar-correlation}. However it can be used to test the presence of \ttbar correlation and to distinguish it from a potential \gls{bsm} scenario without correlation.

\subsection{Single top quark production}
%##############################################

Top quarks can be produced singly through electroweak interactions. At \gls{lo}, one can categorized the production into three channels depending on the exchanged $\mathrm{W}$~boson and its virtuality $Q^{2}=-p_{\mu}p^{\mu}$. Figure~\ref{fig:theory-feynman-singletop} shows the corresponding Feynman diagrams. Overall, the single-top-quark cross sections are smaller than for pair production due to the electroweak coupling strength $\aw<\as$. Additionally, the requirement of sea quarks~($\mathrm{b}$, $\bar{\mathrm{q}}$) in the initial states whose \glspl{pdf} increase less steeply at low momentum fractions compared to the gluon \gls{pdf} suppresses the cross sections further~(see Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-nnpdf-dist}).

}
\begin{description}
\item[$\boldsymbol{t}$ channel] The $t$-channel single-top-quark production mode~(Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-singletop-tch}) has the highest cross section in $\mathrm{pp}$ collisions. Here, the virtuality of the $\mathrm{W}$~boson is found to be $Q^2>0$ and hence it is said to be ``space-like''. A characteristic feature of this mode is the additional spectator quark $q^\prime$ which recoils against the $\mathrm{W}$~boson and is therefore scattered fairly forward. The $t$-channel production of top quarks compared to top antiquarks occurs asymmetric. Top quarks are produced very roughly two time more often than top antiquark reflecting the $\mathrm{u}$ over the $\mathrm{d}$~valence quark composition of the proton. This ratio depends however on the center-of-mass energy where at higher energies, lower momentum fractions are reached at which the contributions from the valence quarks become less dominant. Hence the $\sigma(\mathrm{t})/\sigma(\bar{\mathrm{t}})$ charge ratio is sensitive to proton \glspl{pdf} ratio.
\item[$\boldsymbol{s}$ channel] The mode with the smallest single-top-quark production cross section is via the $s$ channel~(Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-singletop-sch}). This is because of the ``time-like'' $\mathrm{W}$~boson which has to have a large virtuality $Q^2<0$ to produce the heavier top quark. In various \gls{bsm} scenarios, the cross section of this process is expected to increase due to new heavy particles such as $\mathrm{W}^\prime$ or charged Higgs bosons which may even be produced on their mass shell, $p_{\mu}p^{\mu}-m^{2}=0$, and hence occur as a resonance.
\item[tW channel] The second largest mode is the production of a single top quark in association with a $\mathrm{W}$~boson~(Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-singletop-tWch}). Here, the $\mathrm{W}$~boson can be produced on shell $Q^2=-m_\mathrm{W}^{2}$. It is slangy referred to as ``tW channel''. This process interferes at \gls{nlo} with \ttbar production which complicates its definition. A recent approach is to combine both production modes and the inference between them into a process with a $\mathrm{W}^{\rmplus}\mathrm{W}^{\rmminus}\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}+X$ final state~\cite{Cascioli:2013wga}.
\end{description}

The theoretical cross sections of the three single top quark production modes in pp collisions for center-of-mass energies of $8$ and $13~\TeV$, relevant for this thesis, are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-singletop-xsecs}. These have been calculated at \gls{nlo} in \gls{qcd} with \textsc{\gls{hathor}}\,$2.1$~\cite{Aliev:2010zk,Kant:2014oha} using a top quark mass of $m_\mathrm{t}=172.5~\GeV$ and factorization and renormalization scales of $\mu_\mathrm{R}=\mu_\mathrm{F}=m_\mathrm{t}$. The \gls{pdf} uncertainty includes also the uncertainty on \as.

Measurements of single-top-quark cross sections allow to extract a model-independent limit on the \gls{ckm} matrix element $\vtb$. If one assumes $|\vtd|^2+|\vts|^2\ll|\vtb|^2$ then the $\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{bW}$ branching ratio can be approximated as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{bW})=\frac{|\vtb|^2}{\underbrace{|\vtd|^2+|\vts|^2}_{\ll|\vtb|^2}+|\vtb|^2}\approx 100\%.
\end{equation}

Hence the cross section is independent of the top quark decay vertex and therefore directly proportional to $\propto|f_\mathrm{L}\cdot\vtb|^2$. The form factor $f_\mathrm{L}$ is introduced to absorb potential contributions from \gls{bsm} physics that modify the left-handed coupling strength. It is $f_\mathrm{L}^\mathrm{SM}=1$ in the \gls{sm}. A measured single-top-quark cross section can then be used to extract the absolute value of $|f_\mathrm{L}\vtb|$ as

\begin{equation}
|f_\mathrm{L}\vtb|=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_\mathrm{measured}}{\sigma_\mathrm{theory}}}.
\end{equation}

It should be noted that for this interpretation of single-top-quark cross sections no assumptions on the number of quark generations and subsequent the unitarity $\sum_j|\mathrm{V}_{ij}|^2=1$ of the \gls{ckm} matrix is not required.

In $t$-channel single-top-quark production, the polarization of top quarks can be investigated as well. Opposed to \ttbar production, a high degree of polarization is expected due to the electroweak couplings at \gls{lo} in production and decay. For this, the differential cross section is parametrized as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma}{\sigma\cdot\mathrm{d}\cos\theta^\star_{\mathrm{t}X}}=\frac{1}{2}\big(1+\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}\alpha_{X}\cos\theta^\star_{\mathrm{t}X}\big)
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}$ denotes the polarization along a given axis and $\alpha_{X}$ the spin-analyzing power with respect to decay product $X$. The polarization angle

\begin{equation}
\cos\theta^\star_{\mathrm{t}X}=\frac{\vec{s}_\mathrm{t}\cdot \vec{p}_{X}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(t)}}}{\big|\vec{s}_\mathrm{t}\big|\cdot\big|\vec{p}_{X}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(t)}}\big|}
\end{equation}

is taken between the spin analyzer $X$ in the top quark rest frame and a suitable spin quantization axis $\vec{s}_\mathrm{t}$.
