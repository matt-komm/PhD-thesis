\chapter{Theory and experimental status}

An introduction to the \gls{sm}, its particle content, interactions, and properties is provided in the following. Special focus is attributed to the top quark which is the heaviest known fundamental particle to date. Here, latest experimental results are discussed and the theoretical foundation of the measurements within this thesis is laid out.


\section{General Quantum Field Theory of the Standard Model}

The \gls{sm} describes the interactions between fundamental particles. It is based on \gls{qft} which allows to predict observables of particle interactions. Exemplary observables are production cross sections or lifetimes of unstable particles which can be calculated within its framework -- even fully automatized. The \gls{sm} validity is constantly challenged by comparing predictions to experimental data. No significant deviations have been found so far that would hint towards physics \gls{bsm}.


\subsection{Particle content}

Fundamental particles are objects for which experiments have revealed no internal structure. For example, only an upper limit on the spatial radius of an electron has been measured to be $<10^{-18}~\mathrm{m}$~\cite{PhysRevLett.97.030801}. Such particles are therefore considered as point-like. Fundamental particles can be grouped by their spin into fermions with spin~$\frac{1}{2}$ and bosons with integer spin. The fermions can be further divided into leptons and quarks where only the later can participate in strong interactions. Tables~\ref{tab:theory-leptons} and~\ref{tab:theory-quarks} list the leptons and quarks respectively. Each column is called a generation. It encapsulates an isospin pair which are also referred to as up- or down-type respectively. It is unknown why there are exactly three lepton and three quark generations.

For the neutrinos masses, only upper limits on their masses are given. Those are derived by combining measurements of beta decay kinematics with results from neutrino oscillation experiments. In the \gls{sm}, neutrinos are assumed to be massless.
