I like to thank all the people with whom I had the pleasure of working together during my PhD. 

Big thanks go to Andrea Giammanco for his broad expertise and encouraging ...

Furthmore, I like to say thanks to the ``The Offbeat Physicists'' team, Georgios Krintiras, Hamed Bakhshiansohi, Abideh ``Nadjieh'' Jafari, Pieter David, and Andrey Popov with whom I had a lot of fun discussing about physics and life.

For collaboration on the top quark polarization measurement I like to thank Andres Tiko and Joosep Pata for all the hard work which condensed into the published paper.

I like to thank also my PhD committee members, Freya Blekman, Vincent Lemaitre, Fabio Maltoni, and Andreas Meyer for their input and suggestions.

I also like to express by gratitude to the CMS (single) top conveners, Rebeca Gonzalez Suarez, Alberto Orso Maria Iorio, Abideh ``Nadjieh'' Jafari, Jeremy Andrea, Thorsten Chwalek, Andreas Meyer, and Pedro da Silva. It was a true pleasure to perform single-top-quark measurements in the friendly atmosphere you created.
