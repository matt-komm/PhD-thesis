\chapter{Prospects for differential \textsl{t}-channel measurements at 13~TeV}
\label{ch:prospects}

\intro{Improvements for future measurements of differential cross sections are investigated. These are showcased for an envisaged measurement of differential cross sections as a function of the top quark transverse momentum, rapidity, and polarization angle using $\mathit{36~fb^{-1}}$ of \gls{pp} collision data recorded with the \gls{cms} experiment in 2016. First, the training of a new \gls{bdt} discriminant for separating W+jets from $\mathit{t\bar{t}}$ events in the signal region is motivated. It enhances the sensitivity to the heavy-quark-flavor component of the W+jet background in the \gls{ml}~fit for which a control region can not easily be defined otherwise. Secondly, the requirements for measuring differential cross sections at particle level in addition to the parton level are discussed. Observables at particle level have the benefits of being closer to their reconstruction level counterparts resulting in lesser migrations and a higher acceptance compared to the parton level. A technical study of the most appropriate selection of event at particle level is detailed which has also been published in Ref.~\cite{particleStudies}. The chapter is concluded by presenting projections obtained with pseudo-data since the proposed measurement is currently being developed and thus data in the signal-enriched region have been blinded.}

\section{Setup}
%##############################################

Prospects for measuring differential single-top-quark cross sections as a function of the top quark \pt, rapidity, and the polarization angle at parton and particle level are investigated in the following. The chosen analysis strategy is an extension of the one developed in the context of the measurement of differential cross section of  single-top-quark-production in $t$~channel at 13~\TeV (Ch.~\ref{ch:diff13}). The setup of this study is briefly outlined in the following.

The data statistics for this study is increased compared to the first differential measurement at 13~TeV by using \gls{pp} collision data recorded in 2016 with the \gls{cms} detector corresponding to 36~\invfb. Events containing an isolated muon candidate and two or three jets are selected using mostly the same criteria as in Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-selection}, with a few exceptions as highlighted below. The threshold of the employed single muon trigger has been raised to $24~\GeV$ because of the higher instantaneous luminosity, which peaked at $15.3~\mathrm{Hz}/\mathrm{nb}$~\cite{lumipublic} in the 2016 data-taking period. Consequently, muon candidates with a higher threshold of $\pt>26~\GeV$ are required offline. All other muon selection criteria are kept the same. The analysis of events containing single electrons and two or three jets is also explored. Corresponding data events are recorded with an electron trigger that requires an electron candidate with a transverse momentum of at least $32~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.1$. Offline, an electron candidate has to fulfill tight identification criteria~\cite{CMS-DP-2017-004}. Events must contain a corresponding tight electron candidate with $\pt>35~\GeV$ within the \gls{ecal} barrel region of $|\eta|<1.479$.

For b-tagging a new algorithm, the so-called \gls{cmva}-tagger (combined MVA)~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-15-001}, is employed which includes amongst other inputs the output of the previously used \gls{csv} algorithm in its training. At their corresponding tight working points both algorithms have a mistagging rate of only 0.1\% for light-flavored jets originating from u,d,s quarks and gluons while an efficiency of about 55\% is obtained for tagging true b~jets with the \gls{cmva}-tagger, which is approximately 10\% higher than the b-tagging efficiency of the \gls{csv} algorithm. 

The remainder of the event selection is kept identical to Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-selection} which includes the veto of events containing additional electrons or muons, the jet clustering, and the categorization of events into signal and control regions based on the number of selected jets and on the subset of jets which are also b-tagged.

The following samples of simulated events are used for this study. A sample of single-top-quark $t$-channel events has been generated with the \POWHEG generator interfaced with \PYTHIA{}\,8 and \MADSPIN. The \POWHEG generator interfaced with \PYTHIA{}\,8 is also used to generated events of tW single-top-quark and \ttbar production. Samples of \wjets and \zjets events are generated with the \MGAMC generator interfaced with \PYTHIA{}\,8. Exclusive \wjets samples with zero, one, or at least two extra partons are generated and merged with the \gls{fxfx} procedure~\cite{Frederix:2012ps}. The cross sections for normalizing the employed samples are identical to the ones used in Ch.~\ref{ch:diff13} and can be found in Tab.~\ref{tab:diff13-theo-xsecs} with the exception of the exclusive \wjets cross sections which are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:prospects-theo-xsecs}.

The contamination by multijet events is estimated in muon and electron channel through templates extracted from data in a sideband region. In the muon channel the sideband region is defined by inverting the relative isolation as: $\muiso>20\%$. In the electron channel the isolation requirement is part of the tight identification criteria. Thus a sideband region is defined in the electron channel by inverting loose electron identification criteria~\cite{CMS-DP-2017-004}. The resulting description of data by the multijet templates is validated in the 2j0t control region. In Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-met-wjets} the \met distribution and the distribution of the difference in $\phi$ angles between the lepton and the transverse momentum vector are presented for both channels after scaling the templates to the result of a \gls{ml} fit as detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:prospects-fit}. Both distributions display a good agreement between data and the predictions in the electron and muon channel respectively.

Distributions of the reconstructed top quark mass in the 2j1t signal region and in the 2j0t \wjets and 3j1t \ttbar control regions are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-topmass} for the muon and electron channel. A fair modeling is observed for both channels.

\section{New BDT discriminant}
%##############################################

A shortcoming in the previous measurements within this thesis was the lack of a \wjets control region enriched by heavy-quark-flavored jets. Such a region would allow to validate the \wjets modeling in greater detail. Furthermore, including such a region in the \gls{ml} fit may reduce the correlations between the estimated signal and background yields further. An approach to achieve this is to train an additional \gls{bdt}, referenced \bdttt in the following, for separating \wjets from \ttbar events. Even observables which are correlated to the unfolding variables can be used safely in its training if the resulting discriminant is not used in a signal-enriched region for the measurement. The following observables have been chosen as input for the training:

\begin{itemize}
\item the invariant mass of the reconstructed top quark candidate;
\item the missing transverse energy, \met;
\item the transverse momentum of the dijet system, $(\vec{p}_\mathrm{b}+\vec{p}_{\jprime})_\mathrm{T}$;
\item the event shape C (introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-bdt});
\item the $\Delta R$ distance between the two jets;
\item the $\Delta R$ distance between the b-tagged jet and the lepton;
\item the invariant mass of the \acrlong{cm} system; $\sqrt{\hat{s}}=|p_\mathrm{top}+p_{\jprime}|$;
\item the W~boson helicity angle, $\cos\theta_\mathrm{W}^\star$, defined between the top quark and lepton momentum in the W~boson rest frame (see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory-top-quark-decay} for details);
\end{itemize}

The distribution of the W~boson helicity angle is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-cosWhel}. A good agreement between data and the prediction is observed in the muon and electron channel. The angle is reconstructed under the $t$-channel single-top-quark hypothesis but it might often overlap here with the proper angle for \ttbar events in cases where the selected b-tagged jet and lepton originate from the decay of the same top quark in \ttbar events. For \wjets events on the other hand this angle has no physical meaning. Hence its distribution provides separation power for discriminating \ttbar against \wjets events in the \gls{bdt} training.

\myfigure{\label{fig:prospects-cosWhel} Distributions of the W~boson helicity angle in 2j1t region: (a)~electron and (b)~muon channel.}{
\subfloat[]{\adjincludegraphics[height=4.8cm,trim={0 0 {0.16\width} 0},clip]{figures/prospects/plots/2j1t/electron_2j1t_cosTheta_wH_qcdnone_nol.pdf}}

}

The new \gls{bdt} is trained as follows. The \ADABOOST algorithm is used with a learning rate of 0.2. The number of tested working points for node-splitting is set to 50. It has been found out that the discrimination power increases when allowing for a maximum tree depth of up to 5, compared to shallower trees for this particular classification problem. In total 1\,000 trees have been trained. No sign of overtraining has been observed by checking the compatibility between the discriminant distributions from the training and testing samples.

The resulting \bdttt discriminant is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-bdt-tt} in a signal-depleted region. A fair description of data by the prediction is observed. An \gls{auc} of about 25\% is obtained in both channels for separating \ttbar from \wjets events. Its distribution can be exploited to improve the sensitivity to the \wjets yield in the \gls{ml} fit.

\myfigure{\label{fig:prospects-bdt-tt} Distributions of the \bdttt discriminant, trained for separating \ttbar from \wjets events, in 2j1t (a)~electron and (b)~muon channel.}{

}

The signal-depleted region is defined by selecting events with $\bdttch<0$ using the discriminant of a second \gls{bdt} trained for separating signal from \wjets and \ttbar events. This second \gls{bdt}, \bdttch, has been trained similar to the one used in Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-bdt}. The distribution of its discriminant is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-bdt-tch} for which a good agreement between data and simulation is obtained as well.

\section{Signal extraction}
%##############################################
\label{sec:prospects-fit}

The amount of signal is estimated by performing a template-based \gls{ml} fit to data. The distributions of the transverse W~boson mass and the two \gls{bdt} discriminants are used to construct a compound template as follows. The \mtw distribution as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-fit-templ-mtw} is used for events with $\mtw<50~\GeV$ which provides sensitivity to the multijet event yield. The remaining events are split in two additional regions based on the \bdttch discriminant. For event with $\bdttch<0$ the \bdttt distribution is fitted as presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-fit-templ-bdttt} which is sensitive to the \wjets and \ttbar yields while the amount of signal events is negligible in this region as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-bdt-tt}. Lastly, the \bdttch distribution is used for the remainder of events that fall in the region defined by $\bdttch>0$ and $\mtw>50~\GeV$. This region provides sensitivity to the amount of signal events which can be seen in Figs.~\ref{fig:prospects-bdt-tch} and~\ref{fig:pospects-fit-templ-bdttch}.

}

In addition to the 2j1t region, the two \ttbar control region (3j1t,3j2t) are fitted simultaneously as well. Similar to the strategy described in Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-fit}, multiple \gls{ml} fits are performed to estimate the amount of signal events as a function of the top quark \pt, rapidity, and the polarization angle.

\section{Particle level selection}
%##############################################
\label{sec:prospects-fiducial-studies}

Measuring differential cross sections at particle level has various benefits compared to the parton level as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:technique-levels}. In this section a technical study of the reconstruction and selection of analysis objects at particle level for $t$-channel single-top-quark production is described, which is also in Ref.~\cite{particleStudies}.

In the following, comparisons of the shape, acceptance and the overlap between the parton and particle level with respect to the reconstruction level for simulated $t$-channel single-top-quark events are presented. The distribution of the transverse momentum of the muon at reconstruction level is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-muon} after selecting events with one muon without any requirements on the number of jets. At particle level single-top-quark events are selected containing a dressed muon candidate with a transverse momentum of at least $26~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.4$ which follows the kinematic selection at reconstruction level. At parton level, events are only required to posses a muon from a top quark decay without applying any kinematic constraints. In the top panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-muon} the overlap of common events selected at parton or particle level which are also selected at reconstruction level is shown. The bottom panel displays the corresponding acceptance of selecting parton/particle-level events at reconstruction level. A large overlap~($>99\%$) between all three distributions is observed which demonstrates that nearly all events that are selected at reconstruction level can also be found at the particle and parton level. It should be noted that if muons from intermediate prompt tau leptons are excluded from the dressed lepton definition this overlap reduces to about 94\% instead. One can observe that the acceptance increases towards higher muon momenta, which is a consequence of the muon isolation and identification requirements at reconstruction level that become less stringent. 

\myfigure{\label{fig:prospects-particle-muon}Distributions of the transverse muon momentum after requiring events with one muon at reconstruction, particle, or parton level. No requirement on the number of jets is made. Top panel: common events selected at reconstruction level; bottom panel: acceptance of reconstruction level selection.

}

Jets  at particle level are clustered from stable particles excluding neutrinos and the prompt leptons and photons used in the dressed lepton reconstruction. Resulting jets with a transverse momentum of at least $40~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<4.7$ are selected. The amount of selected jets for events passing the muon selection step is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-njets}. At reconstruction level, events with at least two jets are shown while no requirement on the number of jets is made at particle level. When selecting events with exactly two jets at reconstruction and particle level simultaneously, the amount of events at reconstruction level overlapping with the selected events at particle level reduces to about 80\%. The remaining 20\% of events at reconstruction level have not been selected at particle level due to the broad jet energy resolution leading to a migration of events into either the first or the third jet bin at particle level.

The number of b-tagged jets is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-njets} after requiring exactly two jets in the event at particle and reconstruction level. 
At the particle level, the number of b-tagged jets is counted with the ghost-B-hadron method~\cite{Cacciari:2008gn}. The distribution reveals that a certain fraction of events has two ghost-b-tagged jets although events with only one b-tagged jet are selected at reconstruction level. This is a consequence of the ghost-B-hadron method which has a relatively high efficiency for tagging true b~jets compared to the employed \gls{cmva} algorithm at reconstruction level. Selecting events with only one b-tagged jet at the particle level results in a degradation in the overlap to about 70\% which is considered a non-negligible loss. Thus, in this study no requirement on the number of b-tagged jets is imposed. This simplification leads to a jet assignment problem for the pseudo-top-quark definition which is solved by associating the jet that yields an invariant pseudo-top-quark mass (together with the muon and neutrino candidate) which is closest to $172.5~\mathrm{GeV}$.

\myfigure{\label{fig:prospects-particle-jets}Distributions of the number of jets (left) for events with at least two selected jets at reconstruction level and number of b-tagged jets (right) for events with two selected jets at reconstruction and particle level.

}

The distributions of the \pt and pseudorapidity of the (untagged) jet originating from the spectator quark are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-ljet}. 
At particle level, it is the jet which is not associated to the pseudo-top-quark decay by the invariant mass criterion. 
The observed turn-on in the \pt distribution confirms that the drop in the overlap between reconstruction and particle level from $>99\%$ after the muon selection step down to 80\% after requiring also two jets in the events is attributed to the jet energy resolution. The overlap can be increased by lowering the transverse momentum threshold of jets at particle level which has however not been studied further in the context of this study.

\myfigure{\label{fig:prospects-particle-ljet}Distributions of the spectator jet: (left) transverse momentum; (right) absolute value of the pseudorapidity.

}

Lastly, the distribution of the top quark polarization angle is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-cosTheta}. Its definition requires the full reconstruction and assignment of analysis objects to the $t$-channel single-top-quark signature. It is calculated as the angle between the lepton and the spectator jet in the top quark rest-frame. 
The drop at $\cos\theta_\ell^\star\to1$ occurs mainly due to the applied \pt threshold on the selected lepton as detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:technique-levels}. The drop vanishes in the inclusive phase space at parton level. Hence, measuring the polarization angle at the particle level would particularly benefit from the reduced extrapolation to the fiducial phase space.

\section{Unfolding and results}
%##############################################

The unfolding to particle and parton level is demonstrated for pseudo-data only since the analysis has been blinded. The concept of blinding has been applied in polarization measurement as well as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-selection}.

Distributions of pseudo-data for the \mtw, and the \bdttt and \bdttch discriminants are generated from the simulated samples and the multijet template. In addition a random Poisson fluctuation corresponding to the expected number of data events is simulated per bin. The distributions are obtained in six independent intervals per top quark \pt, rapidity, or polarization angle. The fitting procedure of Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-fit} is applied, and the estimated signal scale factors are passed to the unfolding procedure. Response matrices for unfolding to parton or particle level are constructed from simulated $t$-channel single-top-quark events. The obtained matrices in the muon channel are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-response}. The migrations between bins are significantly reduced when unfolding to particle level compared to parton level as particularly visible for the polarization angle.

}

The resulting unfolded spectra in muon channel for the generated and fitted pseudo-data are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-unfolded}. The indicated vertical bars reflect the expected statistical uncertainty on the estimated signal scale factor which has been propagated through the unfolding. Comparing the spectra obtained at particle and parton level side-by-side one can observe that the uncertainties in certain bins are largely increased at parton level compared to particle level as a result of a low selection efficiency in those bins. This is very significant in particular for the first and last bin in the distribution of the top quark polarization angle. Thus, measuring differential cross sections at particle level as a function of these observables is clearly beneficial compared to parton level in terms of precision.

\section{Summary of improvements}
%##############################################

Potential extensions of the employed analysis strategies in this thesis for future differential single-top-quark cross section measurements and their benefits are summarized in the following.

An additional \gls{bdt} has been proposed to separate between the two main backgrounds, \wjets and \ttbar, in the 2j1t signal region. Since it is evaluated in a signal-depleted region only, observables correlated to the unfolding variables can be safely used in its training without introducing a potential bias on signal events. The resulting discriminant with an \gls{auc} of about 25\% provides additional sensitivity to the W+heavy-quark-flavor yield in the \gls{ml} fit.

The technical requirements for unfolding to particle level have been investigated as well. A suitable selection of events by requiring one dressed lepton and two jets without employing b-tagging at particle level has been devised which yields an overlap of about 80\% with the reconstruction level. The missing 20\% of events can be attributed to the jet energy resolution. Unfolding of pseudo-data showed that the reduced migration and higher acceptance of events results in an enhanced precision at particle level.
