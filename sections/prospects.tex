\chapter{Prospects on differential \textsl{t}-channel measurements at 13~TeV}
\label{ch:prospects}

\intro{Prospects on extending the differential cross section measurement at 13~TeV presented in Ch.~\ref{ch:diff13} are discussed. This study uses \gls{pp} collision data corresponding to 36~\invfb which were recored with the \gls{cms} experiment in 2016. Potential improvements in the training of \acrlongpl{bdt}, the fitting procedure, and in the unfolding are outlined. In particular, the benefits of measuring differential cross sections at particle level are highlighted. For this, a technical study concerning the definition of particle level object and an event selection at particle level for $t$-channel single-top-quark events is detailed which has also been published in Ref.~\cite{particleStudies}.}

\section{Setup of study}
%##############################################

Prospects for measuring differential single-top-quark cross sections as a function of the top quark \pt, rapidity, and the polarization angle at parton and particle level are studied in the following. The chosen analysis strategy is largely based on the one developed in the context of the first measurement of differential cross section of $t$-channel single-top-quark-production at 13~\TeV (Ch.~\ref{ch:diff13}). The setup of the study is outlined in the following.

The data statistics is increased by using \gls{pp} collision data recored in 2016 with the \gls{cms} detector at a \acrlong{cm} energy of 13~\TeV corresponding to 36~\invfb. Events containing an isolated muon candidate and two or three jets are selected using mostly the criteria detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-selection} with a few exceptions as outlined in the following. Due to the higher instantaneous luminosity in the 2016 data-taking period compared to 2015 which peaked at $15.3~\mathrm{Hz}/\mathrm{nb}$~\cite{lumipublic}, the threshold of the employed single muon trigger has been raised to $24~\GeV$. Consequently, muon candidates with a higher threshold of $\pt>26~\GeV$ are required offline as well. All other muon selection criteria are kept the same. The analysis of events containing single electrons and two or three jets is also envisaged for a potential update of the differential cross section measurement. Corresponding data events are recorded with an electron trigger that requires an electron candidate with a transverse momentum of at least $32~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.1$. Offline, events must contain a corresponding electron candidate with $\pt>35~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.1$. The candidate has to fulfill furthermore tight identification criteria which have been specifically designed to select most genuine electrons~\cite{CMS-DP-2017-004}.

For b-tagging a new algorithm, the so-called \gls{cmva}-tagger (combined MVA)~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-15-001} is employed which includes amongst others the output of the previously used \gls{csv} algorithm in its training as well. At its tight working point an efficiency of about 55\% is obtained for true b~jets which is approximately 5\% higher than the efficiency of the \gls{csv} algorithm while both algorithms have a mistagging rate of only 0.1\% for light-flavored jets originating from u,d,s quarks and gluons.

The remainder of the event selection is kept identical to Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-selection} which concerns the veto of events containing additional leptons, the jet clustering, and the categorization of events into signal and control regions based on the number of selected jets and b-tags.

The following samples of simulated events are used for this study. A sample of single-top-quark $t$-channel events has been generated with the \POWHEG generator interfaced with \PYTHIA{}8 and \MADSPIN. The \POWHEG generator interfaced with \PYTHIA{}8 is also used to generated events of tW single-top-quark and \ttbar production. Samples of \wjets and \zjets production are generated with the \MGAMC generator interfaced with \PYTHIA{}8. Exclusive \wjets samples with zero, one, or two extra jets are generated and merged with the \gls{fxfx} procedure~\cite{Frederix:2012ps}. The cross sections for normalizing these samples are identical to the ones used in Ch.~\ref{ch:diff13} and can be found in Tab.~\ref{tab:diff13-theo-xsecs} with the exception of the exclusive \wjets cross sections which are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:prospects-theo-xsecs} instead.

The contamination by multijet events are estimated in muon and electron channel through templates extracted from data in a sideband region. In the muon channel, the sideband region is defined by inverting the relative isolation as $\muiso>20\%$. In the electron channel the isolation requirement is part of the used tight identification criteria. A sideband region is defined in the electron channel by inverting corresponding loose identification criteria. The resulting description of data by the multijet templates is validated in the 2j0t control region. In Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-met-wjets} the \met distribution and the distribution of the difference in $\phi$ angles between the lepton and the transverse momentum vector are presented for both channels after scaling the templates to the result of a \gls{ml} fit as detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:prospects-fit}. The \met distributions display a good agreement between the data and predictions in both channels. A good description of data by the multijet template is also achieved for the $\Delta\phi(\mu,\met)$ distribution in the muon channel. However, a slight mismodeling is observed in the electron channel (Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-met-wjets-ele-phi}) in the $\Delta\phi(\mu,\met)$ distribution for which some further finetuning of the sideband region is planned to improve the extracted template shape.

Distributions of the reconstructed top quark mass in the 2j1t signal and 3j1t \ttbar control regions after the event selection and top quark reconstruction are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-topmass} for muon and electron channel. A fair modeling is observed for both channels although a slight slope can be seen in the data-to-\gls{mc} ratio for the electron channel which may however not be significant when evaluating the impact by systematic uncertainties. The additional b-tag requirement reduces the contribution by multijet events in both channels to a comparable fraction as opposed to the 2j0t control region (Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-met-wjets}) where the electron channel appears to be contaminated by more than twice as many multijet events compared to the muon channel.

\section{New BDT training}
%##############################################

One shortcoming in the previous measurements within this thesis was the lack of a \wjets control region enriched by heavy-flavored jets. Such a region would allow to validate the \wjets modeling in greater detail. Furthermore, including such a region in the \gls{ml} fit may help to reduce the correlations between the estimated signal and background yields further. An approach to achieve this is to train an additional \gls{bdt}, referenced \bdttt in the following, for separating \wjets from \ttbar events. Even observables which are correlated to the unfolding variables can be used safely in its training if the resulting discriminant is not used in a signal-enriched region for the measurement. The following observables have been chosen as input for the training:

\begin{itemize}
\item the invariant mass of the reconstructed top quark candidate;
\item the missing transverse energy, \met;
\item the transverse momentum of the dijet system, $(\vec{p}_\mathrm{b}+\vec{p}_{\jprime})_\mathrm{T}$;
\item the event shape C (introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-bdt});
\item the $\Delta R$ distance between the two jets;
\item the $\Delta R$ distance between the b-tagged jet and the lepton;
\item the invariant mass of the \acrlong{cm} system; $\sqrt{\hat{s}}=|p_\mathrm{top}+p_{\jprime}|$;
\item the W~boson helicity angle, $\cos\theta_\mathrm{W}^\star$, defined between the top quark and lepton momentum in the W~boson rest frame (see Sec.~\ref{sec:theory-top-quark-decay} for details);
\end{itemize}

In particular, the W~boson helicity angle has been added to the training whose distribution is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-cosWhel}. A good agreement in the muon and electron channel between data and prediction is observed. The angle is reconstructed under the $t$-channel single-top-quark hypothesis but it might often overlap here with the proper angle for \ttbar events in cases where the selected b-tagged jet and lepton originate from the decay of the same top quark. For \wjets events on the other hand this angle has no physical meaning. Hence its distribution provides separation power for discriminating \ttbar against \wjets events in the \gls{bdt} training.

\myfigure{\label{fig:prospects-cosWhel} Distributions of the W~boson helicity angle in 2j1t (a)~electron and (b)~muon channel.}{
\subfloat[]{\adjincludegraphics[height=4.8cm,trim={0 0 {0.16\width} 0},clip]{figures/prospects/plots/2j1t/electron_2j1t_cosTheta_wH_qcdnone_nol.pdf}}

}


The resulting \bdttt discriminant is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-bdt-tt} in a signal-depleted region. A fair description of data by the prediction is observed. An \gls{auc} of about 25\% is obtained in both channels. Although this new discriminant does yield a region dominated by W+heavy flavored jets its distribution can be exploited for improving the \gls{ml} fit result.

\myfigure{\label{fig:prospects-bdt-tt} Distributions of the \bdttt discriminant, trained for separating \ttbar from \wjets events, in 2j1t (a)~electron and (b)~muon channel.}{

}

The signal-depleted region is defined by selecting events with $\bdttch<0$ using the discriminant of a second \gls{bdt} trained for separating signal from \wjets and \ttbar events that has been setup similar to the one used in Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-bdt}. Its distribution is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-bdt-tch} where however data in the signal-enriched region ($\bdttch>0$) has been blinded since the strategy of the envisaged measurement is still being optimized.

\section{Signal extraction}
%##############################################
\label{sec:prospects-fit}

The amount of signal is estimated by performing a \gls{ml} fit to data. The distributions of the transverse W~boson mass and the two \gls{bdt} discriminants are used to construct a compound template as follows. In the fit the \mtw distribution as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-fit-templ-mtw} is used for events with $\mtw<50~\GeV$ which provides sensitivity to the multijet event yield. The remaining events are split in two additional regions based on the \bdttch discriminant. For event with $\bdttch<0$ the \bdttt distribution is fitted as presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-fit-templ-bdttt} which is sensitive to the \wjets and \ttbar yields while the contribution by signal events is negligible in this region. Lastly, the \bdttch distribution is used for the remainder of events that fall in the region defined by $\bdttch$ and $\bdtqcd$. This region provides sensitivity to the amount of signal events which can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-fit-templ-bdttch}.

}

In addition to the 2j1t region, the two \ttbar control region (3j1t,3j2t) are fitted simultaneously as well. Similar to the strategy described in Sec.~\ref{sec:diff13-fit} multiple \gls{ml} fits are performed to estimated the amount of signal events as a function of the top quark \pt, rapidity, and the polarization angle.

\section{Particle level selection}
%##############################################
\label{sec:prospects-fiducial-studies}

Measuring differential cross sections at particle level has various benefits compared to the parton level as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:technique-levels}. In this section a technical study about the reconstruction and selection of analysis objects at particle level for $t$-channel single-top-quark production is described which is based on Ref.~\cite{particleStudies}.


The distribution of the transverse momentum of the muon at reconstruction level is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-muon} after selecting events with one muon only. 
For comparison, the top panel shows the overlap of common events selected at parton/particle which are also selected at reconstruction level. The bottom panel displays the corresponding acceptance of selecting parton/particle-level events at reconstruction level. A large overlap~($>99\%$) between all three distributions is observed which demonstrates that nearly all events selected at reconstruction level can also be found at particle and parton levels. 
It should be noted that if muons from intermediate prompt tau leptons would be excluded from the dressed lepton definition this overlap reduces to about 94\% instead. The bottom panel displays the acceptance of events at particle and parton levels which are simultaneously selected at reconstruction level as well. 
Hence, the inverse of the acceptance is what needs to be corrected by unfolding the reconstructed distribution to either particle or parton level. 
Overall, the acceptance increases towards higher muon momenta which is a consequence of the muon isolation and identification requirements that become less stringent. 
Furthermore, the particle level distribution displays a sharp turn-on at the muon \pt threshold which suggests that the muon momenta resolution is fairly similar to the reconstructed muon momentum.

\myfigure[p]{\label{fig:prospects-particle-muon}Distributions of the transverse muon momentum after requiring events with one muon at reconstruction, particle, or parton level. No requirement on the number of jets is made. Top panel: common events selected at reconstruction level; bottom panel: acceptance of reconstruction level selection.

}

The amount of selected jets for events passing the muon selection step is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-njets} (left). 
An overlap of about 80\% is expected when selecting events with exactly two jets at reconstruction and particle level simultaneously. 
The b-tagged jet multiplicity is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-njets} (right) after requiring exactly two jets in the event at particle level 
where at reconstruction level events have to pass both event selection steps. 
At the particle level, the number of b-tagged jets is counted with the ghost-B-hadron method. 
A certain fraction of events has two ghost-b-tagged jets despite the events with only one b-tagged jet are selected at the reconstruction level. 
This is a consequence of the ghost-B-hadron method which has a relatively high efficiency for tagging true b~jets. 
Selecting events with only one b-tagged jet at the particle level results in a degradation in the overlap to about 70\%. 
This is considered a non-negligible loss. 
Thus at particle level no requirement on the number of b-tagged jets is imposed. 
This simplification leads, however, to a jet assignment problem for the pseudo-top quark definition. 
It is solved by associating the jet that yields an invariant pseudo-top quark mass (together with the muon and neutrino candidate) which is closest to $172.5~\mathrm{GeV}$.


\myfigure[phtb]{\label{fig:prospects-particle-njets}Distributions of the number of jets (left) for events with at least two selected jets at reconstruction level and number of b-tagged jets (right) for events with two selected jets at reconstruction and particle level.

}

The distributions of the \pt and pseudorapidity of the (untagged) jet originating from the spectator quark are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-ljet}. 
At particle level, it is the jet which is not associated to the pseudo-top quark decay by the invariant mass criterion. 
The observed turn-on in the \pt distribution reveals that the drop in the overlap from $>99\%$ after the muon selection step down to 80\% after requiring 
also two jets in the events can be attributed to the jet energy resolution.

}

Lastly, the distribution of the top quark polarization angle is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-particle-cosTheta}. 
Its definition requires the full reconstruction and assignment of analysis objects to the $t$-channel single-top-quark signature. 
It is calculated as the angle between the muon and the spectator jet in the top quark rest-frame. 
The characteristic slope of the distribution with the exception of the drop at $\cos\theta_{\mu}^\star\to1$ is a consequence of the 
V-A coupling structure at the  electroweak Wtb vertices in production and decay. 
The drop occurs mainly due to the applied \pt threshold of the selected muon and vanishes in the inclusive phase space at parton level. 
Therefore measuring this angle at the particle level would particularly benefit from a reduced extrapolation into the fiducial phase space.

\section{Unfolding}
%##############################################

The unfolding of pseudo-data to particle and parton level is demonstrated in the following. For this, distributions of pseudo-data of the \mtw, and the \bdttt and \bdttch discriminants are generated from the simulated samples and the multijet template which includes a random a Poisson fluctuation per bin. The distributions are obtained in 12 intervals per top quark \pt, rapidity, or polarization angle for fitting. The estimated signal scale factors are passed to the unfolding. Here, response matrices for unfolding to parton or particle level are used. The response matrices in the muon channel for comparing parton and particle level are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:prospects-response}. Compared to parton level the migrations in the polarization angle are particularly well reduced when unfolding to particle level instead.

}

The resulting unfolded spectra in muon channel are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:pospects-unfolded}. The indicated vertical bar reflects the uncertainty on the estimated signal scale factor which has been propagated through the unfolding. Comparing the obtained spectra at particle and parton level side-by-side one can observe that the uncertainties in certain bins are largely increased at parton level compared to particle level which is a result of a low selection efficiency. This is particluar striking for the first bin in the top quark \pt distribution and for the last bin in the polarization angle distribution.
