\chapter{Polarization of single top quarks in \textsl{t}~channel at 8~TeV}

\intro{A first measurement of the top quark spin asymmetry in t~channel, related to the top quark polarization, is presented in this chapter. Proton-proton collision data at $\mathit{\sqrt{s}=8}$~TeV have been analyzed corresponding to about $\mathit{20~fb^{-1}}$. Events with an isolated muon are selected together with two or three jets for the final measurement while events containing an isolated electron and jets have been studied as well. The normalized differential cross section is measured as a function of the polarization angle. From its shape, a spin asymmetry of $\mathit{0.26\pm0.03~(stat)\pm0.10~(syst)}$ is obtained. This is found to be compatible within $\mathit{2.0}$ standard deviations with the expected \gls{sm} asymmetry of $\mathit{0.44}$. The result has been published in Ref.~\cite{Khachatryan:2015dzz}. In a further step, the derivation of limits on anomalous couplings is illustrated by combining this measurement with related ones.}

An overview of the strategy to measure the top quark spin asymmetry and derive limits on anomalous couplings is given in the following. After selecting events with an isolated muon or electron and two or three jets, two \glspl{bdt} are employed. The first one, \bdtqcd, is trained to reject events with fake leptons stemming from multijet production. The amount of multijet contamination after the event selection is estimated through a two-component \gls{ml} fit to the \bdtqcd discriminant where other contributions from signal and background processes are kept together. The multijet background is modeled by a template obtained from data in a sideband region for which the lepton isolation is inverted. The second \gls{bdt}, \bdttch, is optimized to separate signal from \wjets and \ttbar events. The amount of signal and background fractions is estimate through a second \gls{ml} fit to its discriminant. A signal-enhanced phase space is obtained by applying an optimized selection on each of the \glspl{bdt} discriminants resulting in a \gls{sb} ratio of about 90\%. The shape of the polarization angle, $\cos\theta^\star_{\mu}$, in data is unfolded to parton level after subtracting the remaining background contributions. This is repeated for each considered source of systematic uncertainty to estimate their impact on the measurement. The final measurement is performed in the muon channel only since in the electron channel, shortcomings in the modeling of the data-driven multijet template and an overall larger impact of systematic uncertainties are observed rendering its standalone result much less significant. From the differential cross section the asymmetry is obtained by a linear fit while accounting for the induced bin-by-bin correlations from the unfolding. The \TOPFIT program is utilized in a further step to derive limits on anomalous Wtb couplings by combining the measured asymmetry with an inclusive cross section measurement in $t$~channel and a measurement of the W~boson helicity fractions in \ttbar production.




\section{Event selection and simulated samples}

Proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$ are analyzed corresponding to $19.7~\invfb$ recorded with the \gls{cms} experiment in 2012. Events are triggered on the presence of a single muon or electron candidate. The employed single muon trigger requires isolated muon candidates with $\pt>24~\GeV$ which fall within the pseudorapidity range of $|\eta|<2.1$. The single electron trigger fires when an electron candidate with $\pt>27~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.5$ is detected which has to fulfill some quality criteria in addition corresponding to an efficiency of 80\% for prompt electrons. Motivated by the decay mode of the W~boson under the signal hypothesis, the events are categorized into ``channels'' depending if they have been triggered with the muon or electron trigger. In the analysis, events in the muon channel have to contain one muon candidate with $\pt>26~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.1$ that passes the tight identification requirements. In the electron channel, events considered for analysis have to contain one electron candidate with $\pt>30~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.5$ that fulfills the tight \gls{mva}-based  identification. To suppress fake leptons from multijet production, the muon candidate has to have a relative \gls{deltabeta}-based isolation of $\muiso<12\%$ while the electron candidate has to have a relative \gls{effarea}-based isolation of $\eiso<10\%$. Events containing additional muons~($\pt>10~\GeV$, $|\eta|<2.5$) or electrons~($\pt>20~\GeV$, $|\eta|<2.5$) which pass corresponding loose identification criteria are rejected to suppress contributions from \zjets and dileptonic \ttbar production. 

Jets are clustered from \gls{pf} candidates with the anti-\kt algorithm using a distance parameter of $R=0.5$ while applying the \gls{chs} technique to remove the contamination of pileup tracks. The reconstructed jet energy in data and simulation and the energy resolution in simulation are calibrated through dedicated \gls{jec} and \gls{jer} scale factors. Events containing two or three jets with $\pt>40~\GeV$ that are detected within $|\eta|<4.5$ and pass loss identification criteria are considered for analysis. Tagging of jets which likely originated from the hadronization of a b~quark is performed with the \gls{csv} algorithm. At its tight working point an efficiency of about 50\% for tagging true b~jets is found in simulation with a mistagging rate of 0.1\% for other jets. The b-tagging efficiency is reweighted in simulation through scale factors to match the one measured in data. More details about the employed analysis objects, identification, and corrections are described in Ch.~\ref{ch:reconstruction}.

Events are categorized as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-categorization}. The different regions are labeled as ``$N\,\mathrm{j}~M\,\mathrm{t}$'' where $N$ denotes the number of selected jets and $M$ the subset of jets which are also b-tagged. The 2j1t region which contains the majority of signal events is additionally split in two parts based on a \gls{bdt} discriminant. It has been trained to separate signal from background events as described later in Sec~\ref{sec:polarization-bdt-training} which allows to define an additional control region for events with $\bdttch<0$. The analysis has been carried out to be blind to the signal region while validating the background modeling and optimizing the strategy by comparing to data in the control regions only. Then, the signal regions has been unblinded and the measurement is carried out while refraining from any further optimizations. This blinding procedure prevents to bias the measurement which could occur when performing a result-driven fine tuning of the analysis strategy.
