\chapter{Measurement of single-top-quark polarization in \textsl{t}~channel at 8~TeV}
\label{ch:polarization}

\intro{A first measurement of the top quark spin asymmetry in t~channel, sensitive to the top quark polarization, is presented in this chapter. Proton-proton collision data at $\mathit{\sqrt{s}=8}$~TeV have been analyzed corresponding to about $\mathit{20~fb^{-1}}$. Events with an isolated muon are selected together with two or three jets for the final measurement. Events containing an isolated electron and jets have been studied as well. The normalized differential cross section is measured as a function of the angle between the lepton and the spectator quark in the top quark rest frame. From its shape, a spin asymmetry of $\mathit{0.26\pm0.03~(stat)\pm0.10~(syst)}$ is obtained. The result is found to be compatible within $\mathit{2.0}$ standard deviations with the expected \gls{sm} spin asymmetry of $\mathit{0.44}$. The measurement has been published in Ref.~\cite{Khachatryan:2015dzz}. In a further step, the derivation of limits on anomalous couplings is illustrated by combining the measured spin asymmetry with other measurements, sensitive to the coupling structure.}

\section{Analysis strategy}
%##############################################

An overview of the strategy to measure the top quark spin asymmetry and derive limits on anomalous couplings is given in the following. After selecting events with an isolated muon or electron and two or three jets, two \glspl{bdt} are employed. The first one, \bdtqcd, is trained to reject events with fake leptons stemming from multijet production. The shape of multijet events is modeled by a template obtained from data in a sideband region for which the lepton isolation is inverted. Then, a two-component \gls{ml} fit to the \bdtqcd discriminant is performed to estimate the amount of multijet contamination after the event selection. The second \gls{bdt}, \bdttch, is optimized to separate signal from \wjets and \ttbar events. The amount of signal and background contributions is estimated through a second \gls{ml} fit to data using the distribution of its discriminant. A signal-enriched phase space is obtained by applying an optimized selection on each of the \gls{bdt} discriminants resulting into a \gls{sb} ratio of about 90\%. The shape of the polarization angle, $\cos\theta^\star_{\mu}$, in data is unfolded to parton level after subtracting the remaining background contributions. This is repeated for each considered source of systematic uncertainty to estimate their impact on the measurement. The final measurement is performed for muon channel only since in the electron channel, shortcomings in the modeling of the data-driven multijet template and an overall larger impact of systematic uncertainties are observed rendering its standalone result much less significant. The following description of the analysis in this chapter is therefore primarily focused on the muon channel. 

From the shape of the differential cross section, the spin asymmetry is obtained through a linear fit. In a further step, the \TOPFIT program is utilized to set limits on anomalous Wtb couplings by combining the measured spin asymmetry with an inclusive cross section measurement in $t$~channel and a measurement of the W~boson helicity fractions in \ttbar production.

\label{sec:polarization-selection}

\todo{events are recorded based on trigger}
Proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$ are analyzed corresponding to $19.7~\invfb$ recorded with the \gls{cms} experiment in 2012. Events are triggered on the presence of a single muon or electron candidate. The employed single muon trigger requires an isolated muon candidate with $\pt>24~\GeV$ within the pseudorapidity range of $|\eta|<2.1$. The single electron trigger fires when an electron candidate with $\pt>27~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.5$ is detected that has to fulfill some additional quality criteria with an efficiency of 80\% for prompt electrons. Events are categorized into ``channels'' depending on whether they have been triggered with the muon or electron trigger. For analysis, events in the muon channel have to contain one muon candidate with $\pt>26~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.1$ that passes the tight identification requirements. In the electron channel, events considered for analysis have to contain one electron candidate with $\pt>30~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<2.5$ where however the \gls{ecal} barrel-endcap transition region is excluded. In addition, the electron candidate has to fulfill the tight \gls{mva}-based identification requirements. To suppress fake leptons from multijet production, the muon candidate is required to be isolated with a relative \gls{deltabeta}-based isolation of $\muiso<12\%$ within a cone of $\Delta R<0.4$ whereas a relative \gls{effarea}-based isolation of $\eiso<10\%$ in a cone of $\Delta R <0.3$ is required for the electron candidate instead. Events containing additional muons~($\pt>10~\GeV$, $|\eta|<2.5$, $\muiso<20\%$) or electrons~($\pt>20~\GeV$, $|\eta|<2.5$, $\eiso<15\%$) which pass corresponding loose identification criteria are rejected to suppress contributions from \zjets and dileptonic \ttbar production. 

Jets are clustered from \gls{pf} candidates with the anti-\kt algorithm using a distance parameter of $R=0.5$ while applying the \gls{chs} technique~\cite{CMS-PAS-JME-14-001} to mitigate the influence by pileup. \gls{pf} candidates belonging to preselected muon or electron candidates that are loosely isolated are not clustered into jets to prevent double counting. In addition, jets which are within $\Delta R<0.3$ to the selected tight lepton are ignored in the analysis. The reconstructed jet energy in data and simulation and the energy resolution in simulation are calibrated through dedicated \gls{jec} and \gls{jer} scale factors. Events which contain, in addition to a tight lepton, two or three jets with $\pt>40~\GeV$ within $|\eta|<4.5$ that pass loss identification criteria are considered for analysis. B-tagging of jets is performed with the \gls{mva}-based \gls{csv} algorithm~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012jua}. B-tagged jets are restricted to $|\eta|<2.4$ since the algorithm operates only within the acceptance of the inner tracking system. In simulation an efficiency of about 50\% for tagging true b~jets with a mistagging rate of 0.1\% for other jets is found at the employed tight working point of the algorithm. In simulation the b-tagging efficiency is reweighted through scale factors to match the one measured in data. More details about the analysis objects, identification, and corrections are described in Ch.~\ref{ch:reconstruction}.

After the selection, events are categorized per lepton channel as visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-categorization}. The regions are labeled as ``$N\,\mathrm{j}~M\,\mathrm{t}$'' where $N$ denotes the number of selected jets and $M$ the subset of jets which are also b-tagged. Control regions dominated by either \wjets~(2j0t) or \ttbar~(3j1t, 3j2t) production are defined besides the signal region~(2j1t) as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-categorization}. The analysis was developed by validating the background modeling and optimizing the strategy using data in the control regions only. During this process, distributions of data in the signal region have not been used which is commonly referred to as ``blinding''. After the strategy is fixed the final measurement was conducted by unblinding the signal region while refraining from any further optimizations. Thus, the blinding procedure prevents a result-driven tuning of the analysis strategy which may otherwise bias the result.

Various samples of simulated events of signal and background processes are generated. The default $t$-channel single-top-quark sample is generated in 5~\gls{fs} using the \POWHEG generator interfaced with \PYTHIA6 for parton showering and \TAUOLA to simulate the decay of tau leptons. For comparison, two additional, alternative signal samples are generated. One utilizes the \AMC generator interfaced with \PYTHIA8 in 4~\gls{fs} while the other employs the \COMPHEP generator interfaced with \PYTHIA6. A set of special samples with anomalous Wtb couplings is generated as well using the \COMPHEP generator for cross checking the analysis strategy. Samples containing single-top-quark events produced via tW and $s$~channel are generated with \POWHEG interfaced with \PYTHIA6 and \TAUOLA. The major background processes, \wjets, \zjets, and \ttbar, are generated with the \MG generator interfaced with \PYTHIA6 and \TAUOLA as well. Samples with up to three~(\ttbar) or four~(\wjets,\zjets) additional partons at \gls{me} level are merged together using the \gls{mlm} procedure. For \wjets production, an alternative sample generated with the \SHERPA[format=hyperbf] generator~\cite{Hoeche:2012ft} is employed for validation purposes. In this thesis, \wjets events are categorized based on their jet flavor content. Events with at least one heavy-quark flavored jet from either c, or b~quarks are abbreviated as ``\glsmark{whf}'' while events with only light-quark flavored jets~(g,u,d,s) are labeled ``\glsmark{wlf}'' instead. Diboson production~(WW, WZ, ZZ) is found to be only a minor background and simulated with \PYTHIA6. The theoretical \gls{sm} cross sections used to normalize these samples are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:polarization-theo-xsecs}. Throughout this chapter signal and background templates are presented after they have been scaled to the result of a binned \gls{ml} fit to data~(Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-fit}) and additional corrections to the simulated \wjets and \ttbar events~(Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-modeling}) have been applied to improve their modeling unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Contributions from fake leptons produced in multijet events that survive the event selection are not simulated but estimated from data through the following procedure instead. The shape of multijet events per channel is extracted from a sideband region for which the isolation of the lepton is inverted in the event selection as $\muiso>20\%$ and $\eiso>15\%$, respectively. The resulting distribution of data after subtracting the remaining contamination by other processes serves as a template to model the shape of multijet production. The amount of multijet events in signal and control regions is estimated by fitting the extracted template to data which is described later in Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-fit}. Figure~\ref{fig:polarization-qcd-template-antiiso} shows the distribution of the transverse W~boson mass in the 2j1t sideband region of the muon channel. The contribution of other processes in the sideband region amounts to a contamination of only 9\% (2\%) in muon (electron) channel respectively. The resulting multijet template after it has been fitted to data in the 2j1t region of the muon channel is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-qcd-template-iso}. The data-driven procedure yields a good description of the unknown multijet shape in the 2j1t region here.

Distributions of the reconstructed top quark mass in muon and electron channel are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-topmass} after the event selection and the estimation of multijet events have been performed. In control regions containing no or more than one b-tagged jet, the jet with the highest value of the \gls{csv} discriminant is associated to the top quark decay to calculate the top quark mass.  The presented distributions demonstrate that data is well described by the simulated event samples and the data-driven multijet templates in control and signal regions for both channel.

\section{Training of Boosted Decision Trees}
%##############################################
\label{sec:polarization-bdt-training}

Two \glspl{bdt} are trained in this analysis whose output is utilized two-fold, i.e. for estimating the amount of signal and background events in data and to obtain a signal-enriched phase space. The first \gls{bdt}, labeled \bdtqcd, is trained to reject background events stemming from multijet production. Simulated $t$-channel single-top-quark events are set as signal whereas data events in the sideband region, from which the multijet template is extracted, are set as background in its training. The \GRADIENTBOOST procedure is chosen with a relatively low shrinkage of 10\%. The number of single decision trees is restricted to 50 while each tree is kept shallow with a maximum depth of two. The minimum node size is set to 250 events and the number of scanned working points per node is restricted to 200. These settings are not optimized to yield the best discrimination power but instead are motivated to protect well against overtraining. Overtraining is a particular concern here since the used data events in the training may not reflect the actual distribution of multijet events in the signal region in great detail. Multiple \gls{bdt} candidates are trained to assess which set of input observables yields the best rejection of multijet events with the final discriminant. In addition, input observables which are found to be correlated with the polarization angle or with other input observables are excluded from the training. This optimization resulted in the following list of input observables:

\begin{itemize}
\item the reconstructed invariant mass of the top quark candidate;
\item the transverse mass of the W~boson candidate before solving for the unknown neutrino $p_{z}$ component since this modifies \pvmiss in the case of complex solutions, \mtw;
\item the missing transverse energy, \met;
\item the transverse momentum of the untagged spectator jet~(\jprime);
\item the event isotropy which is defined as $(s_\mathrm{max}-s_\mathrm{min})/s_\mathrm{max}$ with $s=\sum_{i}^\scriptn{\ell,\,\mathrm{jets}}\big|\,\vec{n}\cdot\vec{p}_{i}\big|$ where the unit vector $\vec{n}=(\cos\phi,\sin\phi)$ is chosen in the transverse plane such that it either maximizes or minimizes $s$.
\end{itemize}

The \gls{bdt} is trained on events in the 2j1t region only whereas the resulting discriminator is evaluated in control regions as well. Distributions of \mtw, the spectator jet $\pt$, and the event isotropy are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-qcdinputs}. Other input observables are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:polarization-qcd-template} and~\ref{fig:polarization-topmass} above. Distributions of the resulting \gls{bdt} discriminants in electron and muon channel are shown Figs.~\ref{fig:polarization-bdt-qcd-ele} and~\ref{fig:polarization-bdt-qcd-mu} respectively. A fair agreement is observed between data and simulation for the considered input observables and the final discriminant.

In a preliminary version of this analysis~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-13-001}, events with $\mtw>50~\GeV$ ($\met>45~\GeV$) are selected in muon (electron) channel respectively to reject multijet events. Here, the working points of the \bdtqcd discriminant have been chosen such that a similar signal selection efficiency is obtained per channel.  The chosen working points, their performance, and a comparison with the preliminary analysis are presented in Tab.~\ref{tab:polarization-qcdeff}. The \bdtqcd discriminant allows to reject about twice as much multijet events with respect to \mtw, \met for the chosen working points while retaining approximately the same amount of signal events.

\end{tabular}
}

The second \gls{bdt}, \bdttch, is trained to separate signal events from \wjets and \ttbar production which are the major background processes after applying the multijet rejection selection. It is configured as follows. The \GRADIENTBOOST method is employed with a shrinkage of 40\%. In total, 200~shallow single decision trees with a maximum depth of two are trained. The minimum node size is set to 100 events and the number of scanned working points per node is set to 50. To mitigate a potential lack in the training statistics of the background samples, additional simulated \wjets and \ttbar events from the 2j0t and 3j2t control regions are added to the training, respectively. In particular, this increases the statistics of simulated events with W+light flavored jets which is relatively low in the 2j1t region but may in fact be larger in data due to mistagging. The following ten observables have been chosen as input:

\begin{itemize}
\item the reconstructed invariant mass of the top quark candidate;
\item the missing transverse energy, \met;
\item the transverse mass of the W~boson candidate before solving for the unknown neutrino $p_{z}$ component, \mtw;
\item the transverse momentum of the lepton;
\item the transverse momentum of the b-tagged jet;
\item the invariant mass of the b-tagged jet from the summed momenta of the clustered \gls{pf} candidates;
\item the absolute pseudorapidity of the untagged spectator jet~(\jprime);
\item the absolute pseudorapidity of the b-tagged jet;
\item the invariant mass of the top quark and spectator jet system, $\sqrt{\hat{s}}=\big|\vec{p}_{\mathrm{top}}+\vec{p}_{\jprime}\big|$\,;
\item the transverse momentum of the hadronic final-state system~(\glsmark{hfs}), $\big(\vec{p}_{\jprime}+\vec{p}_{\mathrm{b}}\big)_\mathrm{T}$\,.
\end{itemize}

These observables have been chosen for the training because they exhibit only a low correlation with the polarization angle. A bias may otherwise occur since the \gls{bdt} is trained with a sample of simulated signal events in which a \gls{sm} coupling structure is assumed. In the worst case, a \gls{bdt} may select events in such a way that it artificially reproduces the \gls{sm} shape of the polarization angle in data. Choosing uncorrelated observables makes the \gls{bdt} training blind to the actual distribution of the polarization angle instead. The distributions of some input observables are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-tchinputs} after selecting events with $\bdtqcd>-0.15$ in 2j1t muon channel. The other input observables are presented in Figs.~\ref{fig:polarization-qcd-template}, \ref{fig:polarization-topmass}, and~\ref{fig:polarization-qcdinputs} above. The resulting discriminants are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:polarization-bdt-tch-ele} and~\ref{fig:polarization-bdt-tch-mu} in the electron and muon channel respectively. Overall, a good description of data with simulation is observed. The \bdttch discriminant yields an \gls{auc} of 29\% for separating signal from \wjets and \ttbar events in both channels.

\section{Background modeling}
%##############################################
\label{sec:polarization-modeling}

The modeling of the \wjets and \ttbar backgrounds is studied in control regions before performing the measurement. In the 2j0t control region, two mismodeled observables are found which can be attributed to the \wjets background, after applying the \bdtqcd selection to reject the multijet background. 

The first mismodeled observable is the transverse momentum of the W~boson, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-wjets-reweighting-wpt}, which exhibits a softer spectrum in data compared to simulation. This effect can be explained as an insufficient modeling of the hadronic recoil in such events. The recoil momentum is typically defined for \zjets and \wjets events as the net momentum which balances the momentum of the vector boson in the transverse plane. Primarily, it encapsulates the hard jet momenta but additional soft components can also contribute to the recoil momentum which may stem from the underlying event, photons from bremsstrahlung, and pileup. In this analysis, a simple reweighting of simulated \wjets events in bins of the W~boson \pt is applied to correct the observed deviation. More sophisticated methods can be found in literature, e.g. Ref.~\cite{Abazov:2009tra}. The derived scale factors in the 2j0t control region are also applied in the 2j1t and 3j2t regions. In the statistical evaluation, the shape difference between applying and not applying this reweighting is considered a systematic uncertainty.

Another mismodeling of the \wjets background in 2j0t is observed for the polarization angle itself whose distribution is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-wjets-reweighting-cosTheta}. This is a percuiliar mismodeling since the value of $\cos\theta_\mu^\star$ does not reflect any physically meaningful observable for \wjets events. A similar deviation has been observed in measurements at 7~TeV as well (e.g. Ref.~\cite{Komm-thesis}) which suggests that the deviation might be attributed to the modeling of \wjets events by the employed \MG generator. Therefore, an alternative \wjets sample, simulated with the \SHERPA generator, is used to cross check its modeling. This sample was however simulated with only massless quarks. Hence, the ratio of light, charm, and bottom-quark flavored jets is predicted wrongly. This is corrected by reweighting the flavor ratios to the ones predicted by the default \MG sample. The distributions before and after reweighting the flavor fractions are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-sherpa-cosTheta}. An improved modeling of $\cos\theta_{\mu}^\star$ with the reweighted \SHERPA sample is obtained that exhibits however a slightly opposite trend compared to Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-wjets-cosTheta}. For the measurement, the predicted shape of $\cos\theta_{\mu}^\star$ by \MG is reweighted using \MG-to-\SHERPA scale factors per jet flavor pair combination that are derived in the 2j0t control region and applied in the 2j1t and 3j2t regions as well. The resulting distribution in 2j0t is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-wjets-reweighting-cosTheta-rew} where a fair description of data is achieved. Two additional systematic uncertainties are considered in the measurement which account for the difference between the two $\cos\theta_\mu^\star$ shapes and for the jet flavor composition of the \wjets sample.

}

After applying the described \wjets corrections an improved modeling can also be observed in the distributions of other observables. For example, the distribution of \met benefits from these corrections which is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-wjets-reweighting-met}, where the \met distributions in 2j0t muon channel are shown before and after the reweighting.

In measurements at 13~\TeV~(Ch.~\ref{ch:diff13}) an improved modeling of the \wjets background is achieved by simulated it at \gls{nlo} instead using the \MGAMC generator. In retrospect, the observed deviations here may therefore be attributed to the \gls{lo} accuracy of the utilized \MG \wjets sample.

Another deviation is observed in the \ttbar control region. Here, the reconstructed top quark \pt displays a softer spectrum in data than it is predicted by simulation as presented in Fig~\ref{fig:polarization-toppt}. Similar deviations are also observed in dedicated \ttbar cross section measurements~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012saa,Khachatryan:2015oqa}. To mitigate this, an ad-hoc reweighting of \ttbar events is performed where the weight

\begin{equation}
w=\sqrt{\mathrm{SF}\big(\pt(\mathrm{t})\big)\cdot\mathrm{SF}\big(\pt(\bar{\mathrm{t}})\big)}
\end{equation} 

depends on the transverse top quark and antiquark momenta at parton level. The scale factor function $\mathrm{SF}(\pt)$ has been estimated by fitting an exponential function to the measured differential \ttbar cross sections. Figure~\ref{fig:polarization-toppt-rew} demonstrates that an improved description of data is achieved after this reweighting is applied. However, other distributions become distorted by its application. In particular, the recipe leads to a slight slope in the reconstructed top quark mass which is why it has not been applied for the distributions presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-topmass} above. Since the reweighting mitigates the observed deviation for the top quark \pt spectrum but introduces new ones, it is treated as an additional systematic uncertainty in the measurement. The influence of the reweighting on the shape of the polarization angle is found to be small as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:polarization-toppt-cosTheta} and~\ref{fig:polarization-toppt-cosTheta-rew}.

An explanation of the deviation between the observed top quark \pt spectrum in data and predictions was found through new differential \gls{nnlo} calculations of \ttbar production~\cite{Czakon:2015owf}. It is demonstrated that by including higher order corrections the predicted $\pt$ spectrum becomes softer as well and thus yields an improved description of the measured differential \ttbar cross sections.

\section{Background estimation}
%##############################################
\label{sec:polarization-fit}

A precise determination of the amount of background contributions in the signal region is a crucial ingredient for measuring differential cross sections since those need to be subtracted from data prior to unfolding. In this analysis, the background contributions are estimated through two consecutive template-based \gls{ml} fits to the trained \gls{bdt} discriminants.

The first fit utilizes the distribution of the \bdtqcd discriminant where only the contamination of multijet events in signal and control regions are estimated through a two-component fit. As described in Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-selection}, the shape of multijet events is modeled by a template obtained from data in a sideband region with inverted lepton isolation. To assess the stability of the estimated amount of multijet events, the fit is repeated while extracting the template from different isolation regions. The multijet template is taken to be unconstrained in the fit. The other signal and background templates are summed and fitted as a second component with a log-normal constraint of $\pm20\%$ on their total yield. The fits are performed per channel using data in the regions below the individual working points of the \bdtqcd discriminant for multijet rejection. The resulting event yields in muon and electron channel, extrapolated into the regions above the working points, are listed in Tabs.~\ref{tab:polarization-qcdmu-fitresult} and~\ref{tab:polarization-qcde-fitresult} for the 2j1t region respectively. Similar fits for estimating the contamination by multijet events are performed in the \wjets and \ttbar control regions as well.

\end{tabular}
}

In the remainder of the analysis, the multijet event yield is fixed to the fit result with a conservative systematic uncertainty of 50\% to account for residual differences after the extrapolation into the signal region. An additional systematic uncertainty is considered to account for shape differences in the data-driven multijet template when the lepton isolation in the sideband region is varied.

The individual yields of the signal and background processes which are treated as a single component in the first fit are estimated in a second \gls{ml} fit to the distribution of the \bdttch discriminant. In this fit, similar background processes are grouped together and the following constraints are applied:

\begin{description}
\item[Signal] The $t$-channel single-top-quark template is taken as unconstrained.
\item[Top quark background] The background processes which contain genuine top quarks (\ttbar, tW, $s$~channel) are grouped together. Their summed yield is constraint to the \gls{sm} prediction though a log-normal prior with an uncertainty of $\pm20\%$.
\item[Electroweak background] The electroweak processes~(\wjets, \zjets, diboson) are summed together. A log-normal constraint with an uncertainty of $\pm50\%$ on their \gls{sm} prediction is applied. The relatively larger uncertainty compared to the top quark background is chosen here because the production rates of W+heavy-quark flavored jets are predicted less precisely in the analysis phase space by the employed \wjets \gls{lo} \MG sample.
\item[Multijet] The multijet background yield is kept fixed to the result of the previous fit.
\end{description}

Additional systematic uncertainties are considered in the measurement to account for the relative fractions of the individual subprocesses within the components. A comparison of the shapes of these four components is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-fit-shapes}. Since the \bdttch shape of the top quark and electroweak backgrounds are fairly similar, a large anticorrelation of about $-90\%$ between their estimated yields is obtained in test fits to pseudo-data. To reduce the large anticorrelation the \bdttch distribution is simultaneously fitted in the 3j2t control region as well. By including this region the likelihood is supplied with independent information on the \ttbar production rate. In such extended fits, the anticorrelation is reduced to about $-75\%$.

\todo{mention that 2j0t cannot be included since 2j0t is dominated by light but 2j1t by heavy flavor}

The obtained fit results per channel are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:polarization-yields}. After the event selection, a \gls{sb} of about $13\%$ ($11\%$) is obtained in the muon (electron) channel which increases to $90\%$ ($88\%$) in a signal-enriched region respectively that is defined by applying an additional selection which utilizes both \gls{bdt} discriminants.

\section{Validation}
%##############################################

The final distributions are validated after applying the additional corrections to the \wjets and \ttbar events~(Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-modeling}) and scaling the signal and background templates to the result of the \gls{ml} fits~(Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-fit}) before unblinding the analysis. Here, an insufficient modeling of multijet events through the data-driven template in the electron channel is discovered. The actual problem is multi-layered and outlined in the following. A stability test of the data-driven multijet shape has been conducted where separate fits to the \bdtqcd discriminant in bins of the \bdttch discriminant are performed. The resulting scale factors in muon and electron channel are compared in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-qcdsf}. In the muon channel, the estimated scale factor appears to be stable and in agreement with the inclusive fit within uncertainties. The estimated scale factors in the electron channel however display an instability. The result shows that the extracted multijet template is scaled differently depending on the interval of the \bdttch discriminant in which the template is extracted and the fit is carried out. 

\myfigure{\label{fig:polarization-qcdsf} Resulting scale factors for the multijet template by fitting the \bdtqcd discriminant inclusively and separately in bins of \bdttch.}{
\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{figures/polarization/qcdStability.pdf}
}

Further investigations of the modeling of multijet events in the electron channel revealed that the distribution of the difference between the $\phi$ angles of the lepton and the missing transverse momentum is mismodeled. Figure~\ref{fig:polarization-dphi-lepton-met} shows the corresponding distributions in electron and muon channel. The $\Delta\phi$ distribution in the muon channel is instead well modeled by the multijet template.

\myfigure[!htb]{\label{fig:polarization-dphi-lepton-met}Distributions of the $\phi$ angle in the transverse plane between the missing transverse momentum and the (a)~muon, (b)~electron.}{
\subfloat[]{\adjincludegraphics[height=4.8cm,trim={0 0 {0.16\width} 0},clip]{figures/polarization/afterBgCorr/2j0t/electron_2j0t_lepton_met_dphi_qcdnone_nol.pdf}}
\subfloat[]{\adjincludegraphics[height=4.8cm]{figures/polarization/afterBgCorr/2j0t/muon_2j0t_lepton_met_dphi_qcdnone.pdf}}
}

From these findings it is concluded that in the electron channel, templates from the sideband region provide an insufficient modeling of multijet events. The measurement of the top quark spin asymmetry is therefore continued only with the muon channel. This decision is further motivated by the result of a blind measurement on pseudo-data which showed that a combination of both channel will only result in an improvement of less than 5\% since the measurements are mainly limited by systematic uncertainties.

Since the muon channel is validated successfully the analysis is unblinded. In Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-cosTheta-SR} the distribution of the polarization angle is shown in a signal-enriched region. A slight slope is observed between the expected distribution and data. The background modeling is shown in a signal-depleted region in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-cosTheta-CR} as well, where the distribution of data is well modeled by the simulation.

%##############################################
\section{Unfolding}
%##############################################
\label{sec:polarization-unfolding}

After subtracting the remaining background contributions from data in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-cosTheta-SR}, the reconstructed $\cos\theta_{\mu}^\star$ shape is unfolded to parton level and the spin asymmetry is extract from the differential cross section. The working point of the \bdttch discriminant which defines the signal-enriched region can be optimized such that the spin asymmetry measurement has a minimum of uncertainty. A scan of the expected uncertainty using pseudo-data as a function of the \bdttch working point is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-bdtscan}. Here, only some representative systematic uncertainties are evaluated which have a major impact on the result. If the working point is chosen too low the larger background contamination leads to an increased uncertainty through the impact of systematic uncertainties associated with the backgrounds. On the other hand, the final uncertainty increases as well towards higher working points due to the decreasing signal selection efficiency which influences the statistical uncertainty. Between both extremes a broad region is observed where a measurement with minimal uncertainty can be achieved. For the measurement, a working point of $\bdttch>0.45$ is chosen. 

\myfigure{\label{fig:polarization-bdtscan} Scan of the total uncertainty on the measuremed spin asymmetry as a function of the \bdttch working point using pseudo-data. Only some representative systematic uncertainties have been evaluated here.}{
\adjincludegraphics[height=4.8cm]{figures/polarization/unfolding/scan_mu.pdf}
}

The unfolding to parton level is performed with the \TUNFOLD method. To stabilize the $\chi^\scriptn{2}$ minimization inside the method, twice as many bins are considered at reconstruction level compared to parton level. Since about 6\% of the selected muons stem from intermediate tau decays in simulation, the parton level is extended to include also $\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{b}\tau\nu$ decays. In such events the polarization angle at parton level is defined between the spectator quark and the tau lepton instead which yields a similar shape compared to events where the W~boson decays directly into muons. The resulting response matrix is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-response}. The angle is smeared through manifold effects such as imperfections in the top quark reconstruction and b-tagging where the latter also influences how the spectator jet is chosen. 
 
\myfigure{\label{fig:polarization-response}Response matrix from simulated $t$-channel single-top-quark events in 2j1t muon channel after requiring events with $\bdtqcd>-0.15$ and $\bdttch>0.45$.}{
\adjincludegraphics[height=4.8cm]{figures/polarization/response.pdf}
}

After unfolding, the top quark spin asymmetry is extracted from the normalized $\cos\theta_\mu^\star$ spectrum through a linear $\chi^\scriptn{2}$-fit as

\begin{equation}
\chi^\scriptn{2}=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\,\Big(w\cdot\tfrac{1}{2}\big(1+2\cdot A \cos\theta_{i}\big)-u_{i}\Big)\,\mathcal{V}_{ij}^{-1}\,\Big(w\cdot\tfrac{1}{2}\big(1+2\cdot A \cos\theta_{j}\big)-u_{j}\Big)\,,
\end{equation}

where $w$ denotes the bin width, $u_{i}$ the measured cross section in bin $i$, and $V_{ij}$ the covariance between bins $i$ and $j$. The fit allows to properly account for the induced bin-by-bin correlations through the regularized unfolding. To cross check the estimated asymmetry, an alternative unfolding is performed based on pure analytical expressions. For this, only two bins are considered which does not allow to apply a curvature-based regularization scheme. Therefore, only an inversion of the response matrix $\mathcal{R}$ is performed and the asymmetry is obtained as

\begin{align}
A&=\frac{u_2-u_1}{u_1+u_2}\,,\qquad \vec{u}=\mathcal{R}^{-1}\cdot\vec{d}\\
\sigma^2_{A}&=\frac{4}{|\vec{u}|^4}\Big(u_1^2\,\mathcal{V}^{(u)}_{22}+u_2^2\,\mathcal{V}^{(u)}_{11}-2\cdot u_1\,u_{2}\,\mathcal{V}^{(u)}_{12}\Big)\,,\quad\mathcal{V}^{(u)}=\mathcal{R}^{-1}\,\mathcal{V}^{(d)}\,\big(\mathcal{R}^{-1}\big)^{T}\,,
\end{align}

where $\vec{d}$ denote the distribution of data after the remaining background contributions have been subtracted and $\mathcal{V}^{(d)}$ its corresponding covariance matrix.

To validate the overall analysis strategy, a closure test is conducted. For this, simulated $t$-channel single-top-quark events with anomalous Wtb couplings are injected into the analysis as pseudo data. Various couplings scenarios can be realized by applying a special reweighting technique as used in Ref.~\cite{Khachatryan:2016sib}. It is based on the idea that the single-top-quark cross section can be decomposed as

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\sigma_{t\mathrm{\mbox{-}ch.}}=\hphantom{+}&\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{L}^4\cdot A_{\mathrm{Wb}\to\mathrm{t}}\,A_{\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{Wb}}\label{eq:polarization-wtb-rew-vl}\\+&\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{L}^2\,\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{R}^2\cdot \Big(A_{\mathrm{Wb}\to\mathrm{t}}\,B_{\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{Wb}}+B_{\mathrm{Wb}\to\mathrm{t}}\,A_{\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{Wb}}\Big)\label{eq:polarization-wtb-rew-vlvr}\\+&\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{R}^4\cdot B_{\mathrm{Wb}\to\mathrm{t}}\,B_{\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{Wb}}\label{eq:polarization-wtb-rew-vr}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

if only one anomalous couplings is present while the others vanish, where $A$ and $B$ denote some kinematic function for the production and decay. Here, the vector-like right-handed coupling $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{R}$ is taken to be non-zero while the tensor-like left- and right-handed couplings are assumed to vanish. An explanation of these couplings is given in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory-anomalous-couplings}. Three samples are generated which correspond to the individual contributions from Eqs.~\ref{eq:polarization-wtb-rew-vl}, \ref{eq:polarization-wtb-rew-vlvr}, and~\ref{eq:polarization-wtb-rew-vr} to the total cross section. By multiplying each sample with a coupling-dependent weight, arbitrary coupling scenarios in the $(\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{L},\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{R})$ plane can be realized. These samples allow to generate various top quark spin asymmetries by adjusting the couplings accordingly. The analysis strategy is tested by performing the event selection, the \gls{ml} fits, the evaluation of the two \glspl{bdt}, the unfolding, and the estimation of the asymmetry from the differential cross section with pseudo data generated from the \gls{sm} background and these anomalous coupling samples. A Neyman construction is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-neyman} where the asymmetry is scanned by varying the right-handed coupling.


\myfigure{\label{fig:polarization-neyman}Neyman construction by injecting samples with anomalous Wtb couplings as pseudo data into the measurement to scan the top quark spin asymmetry.}{
\adjincludegraphics[height=4.8cm]{figures/polarization/unfolding/neyman_t_tbar.pdf}
}

A bias on the order of the expected statistical uncertainty is observed for some coupling cases. In the statistical evaluation, a conservative systematic uncertainty is added to the measured asymmetry to cover for this. It should be noted that the bias cannot be corrected through an ad-hoc transformation of the asymmetry since only a very specific coupling scenarios has been tested here. In the \gls{eft} framework the general asymmetry depends however on multiple anomalous couplings in a complex way.



%##############################################
\section{Statistical evaluation}
%##############################################

The differential cross section and the related extraction of the top quark spin asymmetry from its shape are affected by several sources of systematic uncertainties. Many of them have already been introduced throughout this chapter and in Ch.~\ref{ch:reconstruction}. They are evaluated by using modified templates and response matrices during the \gls{ml} fits and in the unfolding. The maximal induced shift per source with respect to the nominal asymmetry is listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:polarization-systable}. In the following, details about sources of systematic uncertainties which have not yet been discussed are given, while for others a reference to their description is provided.

\begin{description}
\item[Limited \gls{mc} statistics]  The uncertainty is taken into account when subtracting the remaining background contributions from data prior to unfolding and in the unfolding itself since it can influence the transition probabilities within the response matrices. Additionally, this uncertainty is also account for when estimating the impact by other sources of systematic uncertainties and thus may result into an overestimation in some cases.

\item[\Gls{ml} fit uncertainty] This uncertainty accounts for the estimated normalization of the backgrounds through the fit~(Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-fit}).

\item[Other background fractions] The yield of each minor process which is grouped into either the electroweak or the top quark background component for fitting is varied conservatively by $\pm50\%$.

\item[Shape and yield of multijet events] A conservative yield uncertainty of $\pm50\%$ is assumed on the estimated multijet event yield. An additional shape uncertainty is taken into account which is obtained by varying the muon isolation in the sideband region for the template extraction.

\item[Analysis objects] A summary of the considered sources of systematic uncertainties related to the reconstruction and selection of analysis objects provided in Sec.~\ref{sec:reconstruction-summary}.

\item[\wjets and \ttbar reweighting] The applied reweighting of \ttbar and \wjets events and its associated uncertainties are motivated in Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-modeling}. 

\item[Unfolding bias] The unfolding bias covers for a potential shift in the measured asymmetry which has been observed when injecting pseudo data with anomalous Wtb couplings~(Sec.~\ref{sec:polarization-unfolding}).

\item[Generator model] The default $t$-channel single-top-quark sample which is generated with \POWHEG and interfaced with \PYTHIA6 is exchanged by a signal sample generated with \AMC and interfaced with \PYTHIA8 to assess the dependence of the generator and \gls{ps} on the measurement.

\item[Top quark mass] An uncertainty on the top quark mass is propagated to the final result by using dedicated \ttbar and signal samples for which the top quark mass of $172.5~\GeV$ in the default simulation has been conservatively varied by $\pm3~\GeV$.

\item[Factorization and renormalization scales] The dependence on the scale is assessed by generating new \ttbar and \wjets samples in which the nominally chosen scale per event for the hard interaction, \gls{pdf}, and \gls{ps} is either doubled or halved. For signal events, the scale variation is approximated through a reweighting of nominal events as

\begin{equation}
w_{\mu\to \mu^\prime}(x_1,f_1,x_2,f_2)=\frac{\mathrm{PDF}(x_{1},f_{1},\mu^\prime)\cdot\mathrm{PDF}(x_{2},f_{2},\mu^\prime)}{\mathrm{PDF}(x_{1},f_{1},\mu)\cdot\mathrm{PDF}(x_{2},f_{2},\mu)}\,,
\end{equation}

where $x_{i}$ denotes the momentum fraction of the incoming parton and $f_{i}$ its flavor. It should be noted here, that the weight does not dependent on the renormalization scale via $\as(\mu)$ since $t$-channel single-top-quark production in 5~\gls{fs} occurs only through electroweak interactions at \gls{lo}. The performed reweighting yields however only an approximation of a proper scale variation because the scale dependence of the \gls{ps} simulation is neglected. The validity of the approximation is verified through dedicated scale-varied samples. These samples are however limited in their statistics after selecting events in the signal-enriched phase space which is why the approximation is preferred over their usage.
\item[\gls{me}-to-\gls{ps} matching threshold] The impact of the \gls{mlm} matching threshold on the measurement is investigated for \ttbar and \wjets events by producing dedicated samples for which the nominally chosen threshold is either doubled or halved.
 
\item[\Acrlongpl{pdf}] The \LHAPDF library is used to reweight simulated events to each of the 52 eigenvectors of the CT10 \gls{pdf} set~\cite{Lai:2010vv} and to additional eigenvectors which are associated to a variation of $\as$. Additionally, the differences with respect to the central \glspl{pdf} of the MSTW2008CPdeut~\cite{Martin:2012da} and NNPDF23~\cite{Ball:2012cx} sets are taken into account.

The measured normalized differential cross sections of $t$-channel single-top-quark production at 8~\TeV as a function of the polarization angle are presented in Figs.~\ref{fig:polarization-unfolded-costheta-tops} and~\ref{fig:polarization-unfolded-costheta-comb} for top quark events, top antiquark events, and their combination respectively. The measured differential cross sections are compared to the expectations by \POWHEG, \AMC, and \COMPHEP. Uncertainties on the predictions through a variation of the factorization/renormalization scales and the \gls{pdf} are found to be negligible.

The top quark spin asymmetries are extracted from the shapes through $\chi^\scriptn{2}$-based linear fits and measured as

\newcommand{\AlResultAntiTopPvalue}{\ensuremath{5.0\% }\xspace}
\newcommand{\AlResultAntiTopSvalue}{\ensuremath{2.0}\xspace}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\AmuT          & = \AlResultTopStatSys = \AlResultTop\,, \\
\AmuTbar       & = \AlResultAntiTopStatSys = \AlResultAntiTop\,, \\
\AmuTplusTbar & = \AlResultCombinedStatSys = \AlResultCombined\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

A comparison with the results of the analytical cross check for which only two bins are used and the unfolding is performed unregularized is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-asymmetries}. The measured \AmuTplusTbar value is compatible with a p-value of \AlResultCombinedPvalue with the \gls{sm} expectation of 0.44 as predicted by \POWHEG, which corresponds to \AlResultCombinedSvalue standard deviations. The compatibility with the hypothetical case of $\Amu=0$ yields a p-value of 0.7\% which corresponds to 2.7 standard deviations.

\section{Limits on anomalous couplings}
%##############################################

The \TOPFIT[format=hyperbf] program~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2010nx,topfit} is employed to illustrate the derivation of limits on anomalous Wtb couplings within the \gls{eft} framework using the result of the presented measurement. In addition to the top quark spin asymmetry, the measured single-top-quark cross section in $t$~channel at 8~\TeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2014iya} and the measured W~boson helicity fractions in \ttbar events at 8~TeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2016fky} are included in the limit estimation as well. Potential correlations between the results of these measurements are ignored. The limits are derived in the hyperplane spanned by the anomalous couplings $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{L}$, $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{R}$, $\mathrm{g}_\mathrm{L}$, $\mathrm{g}_\mathrm{R}$, and the single-top-quark polarization in $t$~channel. The couplings are assumed to be real and the polarization is restricted to $\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}>0$. Since the polarization can additionally be influenced by 4-fermion contact-interactions in production, two versions of limits are set. In the first version, the polarization is kept independent from the anomalous couplings. Thus, limits on the polarization are only propagated through the top quark spin asymmetry via the relation

\begin{equation}
A=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}\cdot\alpha_{\ell}(\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{L},\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{R},\mathrm{g}_\mathrm{L},\mathrm{g}_\mathrm{R})\,,
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_{\ell}$ denotes the spin-analyzing power of the lepton. For the second version of limits, potential extra couplings in $t$-channel production are ignored. Thus, the polarization is a fixed function of the anomalous couplings. 

The resulting limits are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:polarization-limits} where two-dimensional projections of the five-dimensional anomalous coupling-polarization hyperspace are shown.
