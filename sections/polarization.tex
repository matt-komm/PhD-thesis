\chapter{Polarization of single top quarks in t~channel at 8~TeV}

\intro{A first measurement of the top quark spin asymmetry in t~channel is presented which is related to the top quark polarization.  Proton-proton collision data are analyzed corresponding to about $\mathit{20~fb^{-1}}$. Events with an isolated muon or electron are selected together with two or three jets. A region enriched in single top quark events is selected by employing two \glspl{bdt}. The normalized differential cross section is measured as a function of the polarization angle. For the shape, a spin asymmetry of $\mathit{0.26\pm0.03~(stat)\pm0.10~(syst)}$ is obtained. This is found to be compatible within 2.0 standard deviations with the expected \gls{sm} asymmetry of $\mathit{0.44}$. In a further step, the derivation of limits on anomalous couplings is illustrated by combining this measurement with related ones.}
