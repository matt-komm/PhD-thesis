\chapter{The top quark}
%##############################################
\label{ch:top}

\intro{A theoretical introduction about the top quark and its production mechanisms is given in this chapter. A feature of the top quark is that its spin orientation is preserved in decays due to an interplay between its high mass and electroweak interactions which allows to study the coupling structure of various processes. In particular, aspects of the production of single top quarks in \textit{t}~channel via W~boson exchange are detailed. Furthermore, \gls{bsm} production mechanisms, detectable through an alteration of the Wtb coupling structure, are discussed which can be characterized using \acrlong{eft}. The chapter is concluded with a discussion of recent experimental results.}

The top quark is the heaviest known fundamental particle so far. Its high mass of $m_\mathrm{t}=172.44\pm0.49~\GeV$~\cite{Khachatryan:2015hba} is close to the minimum of the Higgs potential. From Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-quark-yukawa} one obtains

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{top\mbox{-}Yukawa~int.}=-\frac{\lambda_\mathrm{t}\,v}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\,\bar{\mathrm{t}}_\mathrm{L}\mathrm{t}_\mathrm{R}-\frac{\lambda_\mathrm{t}}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\mathrm{H}\,\bar{\mathrm{t}}_\mathrm{L}\mathrm{t}_\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{\gls{hc}}\,,
\end{align}

which yields a Yukawa coupling strength of 

\begin{align}
|\lambda_\mathrm{t}|=\frac{\sqrt{2}\,m_\mathrm{t}}{v}=0.991\pm0.003\,. 
\end{align}

All other Yukawa couplings in the \gls{sm} are however of the order of $10^{-2}$ instead. The top quark may therefore play an important role in understanding the mechanisms of electroweak symmetry breaking itself. Furthermore, top quarks are excellent probes to search for \gls{bsm} physics. For example, many extensions of the \gls{sm} predict additional $\mathrm{W}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{Z}^{\prime}$ bosons which are heavier versions of their \gls{sm} counterparts and can decay into top quarks. Other \gls{bsm} models can have an extended Higgs sector including additional neutral and charged Higgs bosons which may couple to top quarks predominantly due to its high mass~(see Ref.~\cite{Boos:2006xe} and references therein).

Historically, the top quark was discovered in 1995 by the \gls{cdf}~\cite{Abe:1995hr} and \gls{d0}~\cite{Abachi:1994td} collaborations at the Tevatron collider at Fermilab using proton-antiproton collision data. They observed the production of top quark-antiquark pairs which occurs through strong interactions. Already before the direct observation of this process an attempt to explain CP-violation by introducing the \gls{ckm} matrix and hence postulating a third quark generation~\cite{Kobayashi01021973} which was followed by the discovery of the bottom quark~\cite{Augustin:1975yq,PhysRevLett.39.252} hinted strongly towards the top quark's existence. Another milestone in top quark research was the observation of single-top-quark production which occurs through electroweak interactions only. This process was discovered in 2009 at the Tevatron collider as well~\cite{PhysRevLett.103.092002,PhysRevLett.103.092001}. The lower cross section together with the overwhelming background necessitated the use of sophisticated analysis techniques such as multivariate classifiers and the matrix element method~\cite{Mitrevski}.

With the start of the physics program at the \gls{lhc} in 2009, the production mechanisms of top quarks can be probed with unprecedented precision. This thesis focuses on the electroweak production of single top quarks at center-of-mass energies of $8~\TeV$ and $13~\TeV$.

\section{Decay and W~boson polarization}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-top-quark-decay}

The top quark decays into a W boson and a b quark almost exclusively due to the \gls{ckm} matrix element $\vtb$ which is found experimentally to be $\vtb\gg\vts,\vtd$ and close to 1~(see Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-ckm}). The decay via electroweak interactions is favored since $m_\mathrm{W}<m_\mathrm{top}$ and thus the W boson can be on-shell. This leads to a very short lifetime of only $1/\Gamma_\mathrm{t}\approx 5\cdot10^{-25}~\mathrm{s}$~\cite{Olive:2016xmw} which does not allow the formation of bound states involving top quarks~\cite{BIGI1986157}. Furthermore, the lifetime is even shorter than the typical hadronization timescale of $1/\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}\approx 10^{-23}~\mathrm{s}$. Hence, soft gluons cannot radiate from the top quark before it decays which keeps its spin coherent. The top quark spin orientation can be inferred from the angular distributions of its decay products since electroweak interactions via $\mathrm{W}$ boson exchange feature a \gls{va} coupling structure. This offers the possibility to study the polarization of top quarks from angular distributions in various processes. For such studies, a spin axis has to be chosen along which the top quark spin is quantized.

In the leptonic top quark decay chain $\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{b}\ell\nu$ the polarization states of the $\mathrm{W}$~boson can be investigated independent of the production process~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2010nx}. The top quark decay width is decomposed into

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\Gamma}{\Gamma\cdot\mathrm{d}\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}}=\tfrac{3}{8}\big(1-\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}\big)^{2}\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}+\tfrac{3}{8}\big(1+\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}\big)^{2}\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}+\tfrac{3}{4}\sin^{2}\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}\mathrm{F}_{0}\,, \label{eq:theory-diff-whel-fractions}
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}$, $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}$, and $\mathrm{F}_{0}$ denote the left-, right-handed, and longitudinal polarization fractions of the W~boson respectively. They are dimensionless form factors and normalized as $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}+\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{F}_{0}=1$. The angle 

\begin{equation}
\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}=\frac{\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}\cdot\vec{p}_{\ell}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}}{\big|\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}\big|\cdot\big|\vec{p}_{\ell}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}\big|}
\end{equation}

is taken between the lepton momentum $\vec{p}_{\ell}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}$ in the W~boson rest frame and a spin quantization axis $\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}$. A common choice is the helicity basis where the reversed top quark momentum in the W~boson rest frame $\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}=-\vec{p}_\mathrm{t}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}$ is used to quantize the spin of the W~boson\footnote{There are multiple equivalent definitions in literature for the helicity basis: $\vec{s}_\mathrm{W}=-\vec{p}_\mathrm{t}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}=\vec{p}_\mathrm{W}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(t)}}=\vec{p}_\mathrm{b}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(W)}}$. It should be noted that multiple sequential boosts into various rest frames are Lorentz-invariant but can induce unwanted rotations.}. Figure~\ref{fig:theory-top-decay} shows the Feynman diagram of leptonic top quark decays involving two electroweak vertices, $\mathrm{Wtb}$ and $\mathrm{W}\ell\nu$, which feature both a \gls{va} coupling structure. The polarization angle in the helicity basis is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-top-whel-angle} where the top quark decay chain is drawn in the W boson rest frame.

Potential scenarios of spin orientations at the $\mathrm{Wtb}$~vertex are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-top-whel-states} for longitudinal~($H=0$), left-handed~($H=-1$), and right-handed~($H=+1$) $\mathrm{W}$~bosons in the top quark rest frame. In the last scenario the conservation of angular momentum forces the $\mathrm{b}$~quark to be right-handed. This is however suppressed by the electroweak \gls{va} coupling structure leading to a nearly vanishing probability at \gls{lo}. It would vanish entirely for massless $\mathrm{b}$~quarks since then the $\mathrm{b}$~quark helicity would be equal to its chirality~\cite{Bernreuther:2008ju}. The expected distributions per helicity state as a function of $\cos\theta^\star_\mathrm{W}$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-whel-distributions} together with the \gls{nnlo} \gls{sm} expectation of $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}=0.311\pm0.005$, $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}=0.0017\pm0.0001$, and $\mathrm{F}_{0}=0.687\pm0.005$~\cite{Czarnecki:2010gb}. The non-zero but small right-handed helicity fraction arises from the non-zero mass of the $\mathrm{b}$~quark and from the considered corrections beyond \gls{lo} to the vertices.

For a general analysis of the top quark spin one introduces the so-called ``spin-analyzing power'', $\alpha_{X}\in[-1;\,1]$\,, of the decay product $X=\ell,\nu,\mathrm{W},\mathrm{b}$~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2010nx}. It denotes the fraction of instances when the top quark spin is aligned along the momentum of the spin analyzer in the top quark rest frame. The calculated spin-analyzing powers at \gls{lo} and \gls{nlo} in the \gls{sm} are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-spin-powers}. Additionally, the spin-analyzing powers for $X=\mathrm{q}/\mathrm{q}^\prime$ for $\mathrm{W}\to \mathrm{q}\mathrm{q}^\prime$ decays are provided where $\mathrm{q}$ ($\mathrm{q}^\prime$) denotes all up-type (down-type) quarks respectively. However, studying the top quark spin in those decays is experimentally very challenging since the original quark flavor of a jet and its origin in case of additional final state radiation are difficult to infer. The spin-analyzing powers flip their sign $\alpha_{X}=-\alpha_{\bar{X}}$ in the case of top antiquark decays for the corresponding particle or antiparticle. This holds also in \gls{bsm} scenarios inducing \gls{cp}-violation in the top quark sector.

The charged lepton is a nearly perfect spin analyzer for studying the top quark polarization. Its spin-analyzing power is even larger than that of its mother particle, the $\mathrm{W}$~boson, due to constructive (destructive) interference of the longitudinal and left-handed $\mathrm{W}$~boson helicity states in cases when the lepton is aligned (antialigned) with the top quark spin, respectively~\cite{Bernreuther:2008ju}. Simplified sketches of various spin orientations for longitudinal and left-handed $\mathrm{W}$~boson helicities are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-top-spin-orientations} demonstrating that the momentum of the charged antilepton in the top quark rest frame tends to be aligned along the top quark spin. Scenarios with antialigned lepton momentum with respect to the top quark spin~(Figs.~\ref{fig:theory-top-spin-orientations-long-suppressed} and~\ref{fig:theory-top-spin-orientations-left-suppressed}) are suppressed by the \gls{va} coupling structure which does not allow right-handed particles or left-handed antiparticles to interact. Similar diagrams with reversed spin orientations are expected for top antiquarks.

\section{Pair production}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-ttbar-production}

The dominant mechanism producing top quarks at hadron colliders is top quark pair production through strong interactions via gluon~($gg\to\ttbar$) or quark fusion~($\mathrm{q}\bar{\mathrm{q}}\to\ttbar$). Figure~\ref{fig:theory-feynman-ttbar} shows the corresponding Feynman diagrams at \gls{lo}. Especially the production channel via gluon fusion leads to a large cross section at the \gls{lhc} compared to the Tevatron because of the steeply increasing gluon \gls{pdf} towards smaller momentum fractions. The $gg\to\ttbar$ channel contributes approximately $80\range90\%$ to the total \ttbar production cross section in the \gls{lhc} \acrlong{cm} energy regime of $7\range14~\TeV$~\cite{Olive:2016xmw}. The theoretical \ttbar cross sections in pp collisions at \acrlong{cm} energies of $8$ and $13~\TeV$, relevant for this thesis are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-ttbar-xsecs}. Those have been calculated at \gls{nnlo}+NNLL accuracy using the \textsc{Top++}\,2.0 program~\cite{Czakon:2011xx,Czakon:2013goa} assuming a top quark mass of $172.5~\GeV$. The \gls{pdf} uncertainty includes also the uncertainty on \as.

\section{Single top quark production}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-single-top-production}

Besides producing top quarks in pairs, single top quarks can be produced through electroweak interactions as well. At \gls{lo} one can categorize the production into three main channels depending on the exchanged $\mathrm{W}$~boson and its virtuality, $Q^{2}=-p_{\mu}p^{\mu}$\,. The corresponding Feynman diagrams are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-feynman-singletop}. Overall, the single-top-quark cross sections are smaller than for pair production due to the electroweak coupling strength $\aw<\as$. Additionally, the requirement of sea quarks~($\mathrm{b}$, $\bar{\mathrm{q}}$) in the initial states whose \glspl{pdf} increase less steeply at low momentum fractions compared to the gluon \gls{pdf} suppresses the cross sections further~(see Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-nnpdf-dist}).

\myfigure{\label{fig:theory-feynman-singletop}Feynman diagrams of electroweak single-top-quark production at \gls{lo} in the 5 flavor scheme.}{

}

\begin{description}
\item[$\boldsymbol{t}$ channel] The production via $t$-channel~(Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-singletop-tch}) has the highest single top quark cross section in $\mathrm{pp}$ collisions. The virtuality of the $\mathrm{W}$~boson is found to be $Q^2>0$ and hence it is said to be ``space-like''. A characteristic feature of this mode is the production of an additional spectator quark ($\mathrm{q}^\prime$) which recoils against the $\mathrm{W}$~boson and tends therefore to be scattered fairly forward in the \gls{cms} detector~($|\eta|\sim 3$)\,. In this production mode top quarks are produced roughly twice more often than top antiquarks which is a consequence of the up-over-down valence quark composition of the proton. Hence the production ratio, $\sigma(\mathrm{t})/\sigma(\bar{\mathrm{t}})$, is sensitive to the \gls{pdf} of the proton. The ratio depends however on the \acrlong{cm} energy since at higher energies lower momentum fractions are probed at which contributions from the valence quarks become less dominant. 

\item[$\boldsymbol{s}$ channel] Amongst the three main single-top-quark production channels the one with the smallest cross section is the $s$ channel~(Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-singletop-sch}). This is because of the ``time-like'' $\mathrm{W}$~boson ($Q^2<0$) which has to have a large virtuality to produce the heavier top quark. In various \gls{bsm} scenarios however the cross section of this process is expected to increase due to new heavy particles such as $\mathrm{W}^\prime$ or charged Higgs bosons which may even be produced on their mass shell, $p_{\mu}p^{\mu}-m^{2}=0$, and hence occur as a resonance.

\item[tW] The third mode is the production of a single top quark in association with a $\mathrm{W}$~boson~(Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-singletop-tWch}) where the latter can be produced on-shell $Q^2=-m_\mathrm{W}^{2}$\,. It is commonly referred to as ``tW channel''. This process interferes at \gls{nlo} with \ttbar production which complicates its definition. In the \glshere{dr} scheme diagrams with two resonant top quarks are subtracted from the common amplitude whereas in the \glshere{ds} scheme the contribution from \ttbar is locally removed from the cross section~\cite{Tait:1999cf,1126-6708-2009-11-074}. The difference between both schemes lies in the treatment of the interference term which is kept in the \gls{ds} but removed in the \gls{dr}. A new approach has been developed where the \ttbar and tW production and the inference between them are combined into a process with a $\mathrm{W}^{\rmplus}\mathrm{W}^{\rmminus}\,\mathrm{b}\,\bar{\mathrm{b}}+X$ final state~\cite{Cascioli:2013wga} whose simulation is currently being studied~\cite{Jezo:2016ujg}.
\end{description}

The theoretical cross sections of the three single-top-quark production modes in pp collisions for center-of-mass energies of $8$ and $13~\TeV$, relevant for this thesis, are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-singletop-xsecs}. These have been calculated at \gls{nlo} in \gls{qcd} with the \HATHOR{}\,v$2.1$ program~\cite{Aliev:2010zk,Kant:2014oha} using a top quark mass of $m_\mathrm{t}=172.5~\GeV$ while setting the factorization and renormalization scales to $\mu_\mathrm{R}=\mu_\mathrm{F}=m_\mathrm{t}$. The \gls{pdf} uncertainty includes also the uncertainty on \as.

Measurements of single-top-quark cross sections allow to extract a limit on the \gls{ckm} matrix element $\vtb$\,. If one assumes $|\vtd|^2+|\vts|^2\ll|\vtb|^2$ then the $\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{bW}$ branching ratio can be approximated as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{bW})=\frac{|\vtb|^2}{\underbrace{|\vtd|^2+|\vts|^2}_{\ll|\vtb|^2}+|\vtb|^2}\approx 100\%\,.
\end{equation}

Hence, the cross section is independent of the top quark decay vertex and therefore directly proportional to $|f_\mathrm{L}\cdot\vtb|^2$\,. The form factor $f_\mathrm{L}$ is introduced to absorb potential contributions from \gls{bsm} physics that modify the left-handed coupling strength. It is $f_\mathrm{L}^\mathrm{SM}=1$ in the \gls{sm}. A measured single-top-quark cross section can then be used to extract the value of $|f_\mathrm{L}\vtb|$ as

\begin{equation}
|f_\mathrm{L}\vtb|=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_\mathrm{measured}}{\sigma_\mathrm{theory}}}\,.
\end{equation}

It should be noted that for this interpretation of single-top-quark cross sections, no assumptions on the number of quark generations and subsequently no unitarity of the \gls{ckm} matrix is required.

\section{Polarization in \textit{t}-channel single-top-quark production}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-t-channel-polarization}

The \gls{sm} predicts that top quarks are produced highly polarized via $t$~channel since there are only electroweak interactions with a \gls{va} coupling structure involved at \gls{lo}~\cite{Bernreuther:2008ju}. New \gls{bsm} physics models may however lead to a depolarization by altering the coupling structure effectively through new production vertices and/or higher order corrections. The differential cross section as a function of the polarization angle can be parametrized as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma}{\sigma\cdot\mathrm{d}\cos\theta^\star_{X}}=\frac{1}{2}\,\Big(1+\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}\cdot\alpha_{X}\cdot\cos\theta^\star_{X}\Big)\,,
\end{equation}

where $\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}$ denotes the polarization along a given axis and $\alpha_{X}$ the spin-analyzing power with respect to the decay product $X$. The polarization angle

\begin{equation}
\cos\theta^\star_{X}=\frac{\vec{s}_\mathrm{t}\cdot \vec{p}_{X}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(t)}}}{\big|\vec{s}_\mathrm{t}\big|\cdot\big|\vec{p}_{X}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(t)}}\big|}
\end{equation}

is calculated between the spin analyzer $X$ in the top quark rest frame and a suitable spin quantization axis $\vec{s}_\mathrm{t}$. A potential spin axis is given in the helicity basis where the top quark momentum in the partonic \acrlong{cm} system is chosen, $\vec{s}_\mathrm{t}^\scriptn{\,\mathrm{hel.}}=\vec{p}_\mathrm{t}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(tq)}}$. However, this system cannot be reconstructed unambiguously beyond \gls{lo} when additional \glshere{isr} or \glshere{fsr} occurs. An alternative axis is motivated in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-t-channel-prod-decay} where exemplary spin orientations in the top quark rest frame for $t$-channel production and decay are sketched. There exists a symmetry between the down-type spectator quark on the production side~($\mathrm{q}^\prime$) and the charged antilepton on the decay side~($\ell^{\rmplus}$) leading to a correlation between their momentum directions and the intermediate top quark spin. This suggests to take the spectator quark momentum in the top quark rest frame as the spin quantization axis, $\vec{s}_\mathrm{t}=\vec{p}_{\mathrm{q}^\prime}^\scriptn{\mathrm{(t)}}$\,. At \gls{lo}, this axis would coincide with the axis in helicity basis since the top quark and the spectator quark are back-to-back in the \acrlong{cm} system~\cite{Schwienhorst:2010je}. A high degree of polarization can therefore be expected when quantizing the top quark spin along the spectator quark momentum. This is further motivated by the fact that the charged lepton is a nearly perfect spin analyzer and thus the down-type spectator quark is a good spin analyzer as well because of the depicted symmetry. Higher-order corrections however dilute this symmetry somewhat as also expected from Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-spin-powers} where a slightly lower spin-analyzing power for the down-type quark compared to the charge lepton is expected at \gls{nlo}. 

\myfigure{\label{fig:theory-t-channel-prod-decay}Sketch of spin orientations in $t$-channel single-top-quark production and decay. The figure has been inspired from Ref.~\cite{Schwienhorst:2010je}.}{
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/theory/t-channel-prod-decay.pdf}
}

A crucial ingredient which is however missing in this argumentation is the fact that the spectator quark has to be of down-type flavor for obtaining a high polarization. This is  true in about $80\%$ for $t$-channel top quark production but only in $31\%$ of all cases for top antiquark production. In such events the down-type quark is found with a probability of $69\%$ in the initial state instead. However, the spectator quark is only mildly deflected after recoiling against the $\mathrm{W}$~boson. It is therefore still sufficiently close to the direction of the down-type quark momentum which results in a high degree of polarization nonetheless~\cite{Bernreuther:2008ju}.

The expect degrees of polarization for the top quark and top antiquark have been calculated at $7~\TeV$ and are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-singletop-sm-polarization} at \gls{lo} and \gls{nlo} accuracy. The combined polarization for top quark and antiquark is obtained using a weighted sum with the corresponding cross sections as weights\footnote{The expected single-top-quark cross sections at $7~\TeV$ are $\sigma(\mathrm{t})=41.8^{+1.8}_{-1.5}~\pb$ and $\sigma(\bar{\mathrm{t}})=22.0^{+1.3}_{-1.2}~\pb$. These are calculated with the same setup as used for Tab.~\ref{tab:theory-singletop-xsecs}}. At $8~\TeV$, a similar polarization of $|\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{t}+\bar{\mathrm{t}}}^\mathrm{8~\TeV}|=0.88$ is expected using simulated events from the \gls{nlo} generator \textsc{Powheg}~\cite{Khachatryan:2015dzz}.

The high polarization of the top quark along the spectator quark momentum allows also to extend the $\mathrm{W}$~boson polarization with two additional axes. Figure~\ref{fig:theory-ext-whel} shows the construction procedure. The top quark spin is approximated by the spectator quark momentum. Then the normal and transverse axes are defined as 

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\vec{\mathrm{N}}&=\vec{p}_{\mathrm{q}^\prime}^{\mathrm{(t)}}\times\vec{p}_{\mathrm{W}}^{\mathrm{(t)}}\qquad\text{(normal axis)}\,, \\
\vec{\mathrm{T}}&=\vec{p}_{\mathrm{W}}^{\mathrm{(t)}}\times \vec{\mathrm{N}}\qquad\text{(transverse axis)}\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\myfigure{\label{fig:theory-ext-whel}Extended $\mathrm{W}$~boson polarization axes in $t$-channel single-top-quark production and decay: $\mathrm{N}=\text{normal axis}$; $\mathrm{T}=\text{transverse axis}$.}{
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/theory/ext_whel.pdf}
}

The differential cross sections as a function of the polarization angles with respect to these new axes take the same functional form as in Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-diff-whel-fractions}. However, the corresponding polarization fractions $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}^\scriptn{\mathrm{N,T}}$, $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{0}^\scriptn{\mathrm{N,T}}$, and $\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}^\scriptn{\mathrm{N,T}}$ are probing different aspects of the coupling structure. In particular, the left- and right-handed polarization along $\vec{\mathrm{N}}$ are sensitive to potential \gls{cp}-violation~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2010nx}. Since the top quark is not fully polarized along the spectator quark momentum, the  polarization fractions are modified as

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\tilde{\mathrm{F}}_\mathrm{R}^\mathrm{N,T}&=\frac{1+\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}}{2}\cdot\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}^\mathrm{N,T}+\frac{1-\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}}{2}\cdot\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}^\mathrm{N,T}, \\
\tilde{\mathrm{F}}_\mathrm{L}^\mathrm{N,T}&=\frac{1+\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}}{2}\cdot\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{L}^\mathrm{N,T}+\frac{1-\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{t}}{2}\cdot\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{R}^\mathrm{N,T}, \\
\tilde{\mathrm{F}}_\mathrm{0}^\mathrm{N,T}&=\mathrm{F}_\mathrm{0}^\mathrm{N,T}\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\section{Flavor schemes}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-flavor-schemes}

In single-top-quark production via $t$ channel a $\mathrm{b}$~quark is required in the initial state. There are two approaches called 4 and 5~\glshere{fs} to treat initial state $\mathrm{b}$~quarks in theoretical calculations. They differ in the number of quark flavors considered within the \gls{pdf} of the proton. Figure~\ref{fig:theory-flavorscheme} shows a representative Feynam diagram where in the 4~\gls{fs} the $\mathrm{b}$~quark originates from gluon splitting and is not part of the \gls{pdf}. On the other hand this splitting is resumed into the \gls{pdf} in the 5~\gls{fs} instead.

\myfigure{\label{fig:theory-flavorscheme}Feynman diagram at \gls{lo} for $t$-channel single-top-quark production in 4 and 5~\glsreset{fs}\gls{fs}. The dashed lines denote where the partonic initial state begins.}{
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/theory/flavorscheme.pdf}
}

Since the $\mathrm{b}$~quark mass of $m_\mathrm{b}\approx4.2~\GeV$ is higher than the mass of the proton ($m_\mathrm{p}\approx1~\GeV$) the 4~\gls{fs} seems more natural at first glance. The $\mathrm{b}$~quark is treated as a heavy quark state that decouples completely from the \as and \gls{pdf} evolutions through renormalization and the DGLAP equation, respectively. However, this approach results in terms proportional to $\log(Q^2/m_\mathrm{b}^2)$ arising from the intermediate $\mathrm{b}$~quark propagator which may prohibit the convergence of perturbative calculations at high momentum transfers $Q$. In this case, such terms together with the $g\to\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}$ splitting function can be absorbed into a \gls{pdf} for the $\mathrm{b}$~quark instead which results in the 4~\gls{fs}~\cite{Maltoni:2012pa}.

Both schemes are valid approaches for calculating observables. The difference between them at fixed order lies in their dependence on the energy scale at which a process is described. The predictions by both schemes will thus converge if calculated at sufficiently high orders. This is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-t-channel-xsec-fs} where the $t$-channel single-top-quark cross section at $14~\TeV$ as a function of the renormalization and factorization scale is depicted. The dashed curves show the \gls{lo} predictions in 4~and 5~\gls{fs} respectively which are far apart. Their opposite behavior originates from the running of coupling constant \as in the 4~\gls{fs} versus the scale dependence of the $\mathrm{b}$~quark \gls{pdf} in the 5~\gls{fs} as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-t-channel-as-fs}. Both approach the \gls{nlo} prediction only at low (large) scales for 4~\gls{fs} (5~\gls{fs}) respectively. On the other hand, the \gls{nlo} predictions start to converge already at a scale choice of about $\mu_\mathrm{R}=\mu_\mathrm{F}= m_\mathrm{t}/2$ for this process.

}

Fixed-order predictions of differential cross sections are also sensitive to the flavor scheme choice. Ratios of the 4~\gls{fs} over the 5~\gls{fs} $t$-channel cross sections at \gls{nlo} as a function of the transverse momentum and pseudo rapidity with respect to the top quark and spectator jet are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-t-channel-xsec-fs-diff}. The differences between both schemes are found to be around the $10~\%$ level~\cite{Campbell:2009ss}. In particular, the top quark \pt displays here an almost linear increasing ratio.

\section{Anomalous couplings}
%##############################################
\label{sec:theory-anomalous-couplings}

Direct searches for \gls{bsm} physics can be viewed as a top-down approach. The starting point is marked by a well-defined and usually \gls{uv}-complete \gls{bsm} theory. Experimentally, one is then interested to detect additional events originating from a new process within such a theory. Exemplary models are the \glshere{mssm}~(reviewed in Ref.~\cite{Csaki:1996ks}) or the \glshere{2hdm}~\cite{Branco:2011iw}. Since no signal has been found yet it may be that the energy scale at which a \gls{bsm} process becomes significant is not accessible in direct searches. Nonetheless, potential new particles or interactions will contribute higher-order corrections to processes within the \gls{sm} already at low energies. An example of such a process is the rare $\mathrm{B}^{0}_\mathrm{s}\to\mu^{\rmplus}\mu^{\rmminus}$ decay~\cite{CMS:2014xfa} which can be altered by contributions from e.g. the \gls{mssm}. This motivates a model-independent bottom-up approach where observables of the \gls{sm} are measured with great precision and compared to their expectation. Any deviations can then be interpreted within multiple new theories.

The idea of a bottom-up approach is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-t-channel-eff} for some exemplary \gls{uv}-complete theory contributing to single-top-quark production through a new heavy scalar particle $\chi$. If the new particle has a sufficiently high mass it would not be possible to observe it as a new resonance in $s$~channel. However, the shown production of single top quarks would be altered through additional contributions from this new process. At energies $q\ll m_{\chi}$ it would mimic a 4-fermion contact interaction with a simple scalar coupling structure. The \mbox{\gls{sm}+\gls{bsm}}inclusive cross section of this process may still correspond to the one expected from the \gls{sm} alone by fine-tuning the \gls{sm} and \gls{bsm} couplings correspondingly. However, since this new process has a scalar coupling structure it manifests itself as a deviation from the expected \gls{va} coupling structure of the \gls{sm}. Differential cross section measurements and related observables like the top quark polarization can then be used to probe for such anomalous couplings at the production vertex.

\myfigure{\label{fig:theory-t-channel-eff}Feynman diagram of potential \gls{bsm} physics contributing to single-top-quark production via flavor-changing neutral current interaction. At low energies $p\ll m_\chi$ the propagator in (a) can be approximated as an anomalous 4-fermion coupling as shown in~(b).}{
\subfloat[\label{fig:theory-t-channel-chi-uv}$t$~channel]{\parbox{0.35\textwidth}{\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/theory/t-channel-chi.pdf}\\$\propto \frac{g^2}{p^2-m^{2}_{\chi}}$}}
\subfloat[\label{fig:theory-t-channel-eff-ir}effective interaction]{\parbox{0.35\textwidth}{\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figures/theory/t-channel-contact.pdf}\\$\propto \frac{g^2}{m^{2}_{\chi}}$}}
}

Such deviations from the \gls{sm} coupling structure can be characterized in the framework of effective field theories~(\glsplmark{eft}) in a model-independent manner. Those can be derived using an \glshere{ope} as first proposed in Ref.~\cite{Wilson:1972ee}. Here, products of operators are expanded as

\begin{equation}
{O}_{1}(x_{1})\ldots {O}_{n}(x_{n})=\sum_{i}c_{1\ldots n}^{i}(x_{1},\ldots x_{n})\cdot{O}_{i}^\mathrm{eff}(x_{n})\,,
\end{equation}

where $O_{i}^\mathrm{eff}$ denote effective operators and $c^{i}$ are the so-called Wilson coefficients. The expansion is applicable if $x_{1\ldots n-1}$ are close to $x_n$\,, i.e. only the low energy limit of a \gls{uv}-complete theory is relevant. Otherwise, unitarity can be violated if the energy scale of a process within the \gls{eft} approaches the scale of the concrete \gls{bsm} theory as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory-observables}. In the example above this would be the case when the momentum transfer $q$ approaches $m_\chi$ at which the \gls{eft} approach becomes invalid.

One can extend the Lagrangian of the \gls{sm}, which contains only operators up to dimension-four, into an effective one as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}^\mathrm{eff}=\mathcal{L}^\mathrm{\gls{sm}}_\mathrm{(4)}+\frac{1}{\Lambda}\sum_{i}c_{i}^\mathrm{(5)}{O}_{i}^\mathrm{(5)}+\frac{1}{\Lambda^{2}}\sum_{i}c_{i}^\mathrm{(6)}{O}_{i}^\mathrm{(6)}+\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{O^\mathrm{(7)}}{\Lambda^3}\right)\,,
\end{equation}

where new effective operators of dimension-five and -six have been added. Those are however suppressed by inverse powers of the new physics scale $\Lambda$. This approach leads to 59 independent operators of dimension-six when requiring gauge invariance and baryon number conservation~\cite{Grzadkowski:2010es}. The only operator of dimension-five is

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}^\mathrm{eff.}_\mathrm{(5)}=\frac{1}{\Lambda}c^{ij}_{\nu\nu}\Big({{\mathrm{E}}}^{c}_{\mathrm{L},i}\tilde{\phi}\Big)\Big({\mathrm{E}}_{\mathrm{L},j}\tilde{\phi}\Big)+\mathrm{\gls{hc}},\qquad \tilde{\phi}_{i}=\epsilon_{ij}\phi_{j}
\end{equation}

which can be used to introduce neutrino masses and mixing after electroweak symmetry breaking\footnote{This assumes Majorana neutrinos. The coefficients $c^{ij} v^2/(2\Lambda)$ after symmetry breaking can be interpreted as mass mixing matrix for neutrinos similar to the \gls{ckm} matrix for quarks. The superscript $c$ stands for charge conjugation.}. Only a subset of operators are relevant in the top quark sector~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2008zc}. In particular, the following operators contribute to the $\mathrm{Wtb}$~vertex


\begin{subequations}\label{eq:theory-eft-lagrangian-operators}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}^\mathrm{eff.}_\mathrm{Wtb}&=\mathcal{L}^\mathrm{SM}_\mathrm{Wtb}+\frac{1}{\Lambda^2}\Big(c_{\phi\mathrm{q}}^{33}O_{\phi\mathrm{q}}^{33}+c_{\phi\phi}^{33}O_{\phi\phi}^{33}+c_{\mathrm{dW}}^{33}O_{\mathrm{dW}}^{33}+c_{\mathrm{uW}}^{33}O_{\mathrm{uW}}^{33}\Big)+\mathrm{\gls{hc}}\,,\span\span \\ 
O_{\phi\mathrm{q}}^{33}&=i\Big(\phi^\dagger\omega_{a}\mathrm{D}_\mu\phi\Big)\Big(\bar{\mathrm{Q}}_\mathrm{L}^{3}\gamma^{\mu}\omega^{a}\mathrm{Q}_\mathrm{L}^{3}\Big)\,,&
O_{\phi\phi}^{33}&=i\Big(\tilde{\phi}^\dagger\mathrm{D}_\mu\phi\Big)\Big(\bar{\mathrm{u}}_\mathrm{R}^{3}\gamma^{\mu}\mathrm{d}_\mathrm{R}^{3}\Big)\,,\\
O_{\mathrm{dW}}^{33}&=\Big(\bar{\mathrm{Q}}_\mathrm{L}^{3}\sigma^{\mu\nu}\omega_{a}\mathrm{d}_\mathrm{R}^{3}\Big)\phi\,\mathrm{W}^{a}_{\mu\nu}\,,&
O_{\mathrm{uW}}^{33}&=\Big(\bar{\mathrm{Q}}_\mathrm{L}^{3}\sigma^{\mu\nu}\omega_{a}\mathrm{u}_\mathrm{R}^{3}\Big)\tilde{\phi}\,\mathrm{W}^{a}_{\mu\nu}\,,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

where $D_\mu$ denotes the covariant derivative~(Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-phi-codev}) and the quark field indices refer to the third generation following the notation of Eqs.~\ref{eq:theory-su2-doublets} and~\ref{eq:theory-su2-singlets}. Anomalous couplings can be introduced after electroweak symmetry breaking which absorb all constant terms including $c_{i}\,v^2/(2\Lambda^2)$\,. One obtains

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}^\mathrm{eff.}_\mathrm{Wtb}=&-\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\gamma^{\mu}\big(\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{L}\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{L}+\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{R}\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{R}\big)\mathrm{t}\mathrm{W}_\mu^{\rmminus}\nonumber\\
&-\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\frac{i\sigma^{\mu\nu}q_\nu}{m_\mathrm{W}}\big(\mathrm{g}_\mathrm{L}\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{L}+\mathrm{g}_\mathrm{R}\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{R}\big)\mathrm{t}\mathrm{W}_\mu^{\rmminus}+\mathrm{\gls{hc}}\,,\label{eq:theory-wtb-eff-anomcouplings}
\end{align}

where $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{L,R}$ and $\mathrm{g}_\mathrm{L,R}$ denote the vector- and tensor-like anomalous couplings respectively. In the \gls{sm}~(Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-qqW-int}) there exists only a vector-like, left-handed coupling $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{tb}$ whereas the other couplings vanish $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{g}_\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{g}_\mathrm{R}=0$.

Another effective operator relevant for single top quark production is $O_\mathrm{qW}^{ij}$ which is however not associated to the effective Wtb interaction~(Eq.~\ref{eq:theory-eft-lagrangian-operators}). Its contribution can be mostly absorbed by the other operators as

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{qW}&=\frac{1}{\Lambda^2}c^{ij}_\mathrm{qW}O_\mathrm{qW}^{ij}=\frac{1}{\Lambda^2}c^{ij}_\mathrm{qW}\Big(\bar{\mathrm{Q}}_{\mathrm{L},i}\gamma^{\mu}\omega_{a}D^\nu\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{L},j}\Big)\mathrm{W}_{\mu\nu}^{a}+\mathrm{\gls{hc}}\nonumber\\
&\supset\big(\text{terms }\propto\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Wtb}^\mathrm{eff.}\big)~+~\frac{g\,\mathrm{Re}(c_\mathrm{qW})}{\Lambda^2}\big(\bar{\mathrm{b}}\gamma^{\mu}\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{L}\mathrm{t}\big)\big(\bar{\mathrm{q}}\gamma_\mu\mathrm{P}_\mathrm{L}\mathrm{q}^\prime\big)+\mathrm{\gls{hc}}\,,\label{eq:theory-4q-eff-anomcouplings}
\end{align}

where however a four-fermion contact interaction term remains~\cite{Bach:2012fb}. This interaction does not contribute to top quark production and decays via a $\mathrm{Wtb}$~vertex directly which is why it is usually not added to Eqs.~\ref{eq:theory-eft-lagrangian-operators} and~\ref{eq:theory-wtb-eff-anomcouplings}. However, the four-fermion vertex cannot be neglected when studying in particular single-top-quark production. Here, it can contribute a $\mathrm{udbt}$~vertex (similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-t-channel-eff-ir}) as an addition to the $\mathrm{Wud}\text{+}\mathrm{Wtb}$~vertices which e.g. occurs in the production via $t$~channel.

To investigate the presence of anomalous couplings in experimental data, various (pseudo) observables are proposed in literature~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2010nx,Aguilar-Saavedra:2014eqa,Bernreuther:2015yna}. A few of them are the inclusive single-top-quark cross sections, the W~boson helicity fractions~(Sec.~\ref{sec:theory-top-quark-decay}), and the top quark polarization in $t$~channel~(Sec.~\ref{sec:theory-t-channel-polarization}).

\section{Selection of experimental results}

\label{sec:theory-exp-results}

\todo{update to latest results}

To conclude this chapter, a selection of experimental results in the top quark sector are presented. An overview of inclusive \ttbar cross section measurements at \acrlong{cm} energies of 5, 7, 8, and 13~\TeV are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-lhc-ttbar-xsec} and compared to the theoretical \gls{nnlo}+\gls{nnll} prediction. Measurements of inclusive single-top-quark production in $t$, tW, and $s$~channel at 7, 8, and 13~\TeV are summarized and compared to the theoretical \gls{nlo} predictions in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-lhc-st-xsec}. These cross section measurements can be used to determine the absolute value of the \gls{ckm} matrix element $\vtb$ as detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:theory-single-top-production}. The results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-lhc-vtb}. The currently most precise estimation of $\vtb$ stems from a combination of $t$-channel single-top-quark cross section measurements at 7 and 8~\TeV by \gls{cms} resulting in $|f_\mathrm{L}\vtb|=0.998\pm0.038\,\mathrm{(exp)}\pm0.016\,\mathrm{(theo)}$. This yields a limit of $|\vtb|>0.92$ at 95\%~\gls{cl} when assuming $f_\mathrm{L}=1$ and $|\vtb|<1$.

The results from measurements of the $\mathrm{W}$~boson helicity fractions are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-lhc-whel} and compared to their \gls{nnlo} prediction. These have been mostly obtained by analyzing top quark decays in \ttbar events. However, one measurement uses decays of top quarks from $t$-channel single-top-quark production yielding a comparable precision~\cite{Khachatryan:2014vma}.

Overall, the various measurements presented here show a good agreement with the \gls{sm} prediction. Since no deviation is observed, limits on the anomalous couplings can be derived. Global fits of the anomalous couplings are however a complicated and computing-intense undertaking. Given a certain point in the coupling hyperspace, multiple observables need to be computed and compared to the results from various measurements while accounting for statistical and systematic uncertainties. A sophisticated fitting framework called \TOPFITTER[format=hyperbf] has been recently developed~\cite{Buckley:2015lku}. The estimated couplings strength per operator contributing to single-top-quark production obtained from various measurements at the \gls{lhc} and the Tevatron are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:theory-eft-fit}. The results are found to be consistent with the \gls{sm} expectation where those operators vanish.
