\chapter{Experimental setup}

\intro{The measurements within this thesis have been carried out by analyzing proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector in 2012, 2015, and 2016 at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13~\TeV. The experimental setup is described in this chapter. First, the \glsreset{lhc}\gls{lhc}, its preacceleator chain and other experiments at the \gls{lhc} are briefly introduced. Then the CMS detector and its components are detailed. A review of the operations summarizes the chapter.}
